Photovoltaic (PV) technology, as a low-carbon energy technology, is crucial to mitigating climate change and 
achieving sustainable development. China has the largest total number of PV technology patents in the world, 
but  the  lack  of  core  technologies  has  restricted  the  further  innovative  development  of  China’s  PV  industry. 
Therefore,  it  is  necessary  to  clarify  China’s  current  PV  technology  accumulation  to  better  catch  up  with  key 
technology areas. To clearly describe the structural characteristics of China’s PV technology innovation network, 
this study uses China’s patent PV technology data over the past 20 years from the Incopat global patent database 
and  analyses  the  structural  characteristics  of  the  network  from  the  perspectives  of  one-mode  and  two-mode 
networks, using method of social network analysis (SNA). The results show that 1) the leading PV enterprises 
have basically formed relatively stable internal collaborations and that the scale of innovation network devel-
opment has expanded rapidly, with very strong stamina; 2) with the development of China’s PV industry, many 
innovative PV techniques have been developed by leading enterprises in the field of innovation and research and 
development (R&D) of PV technology, and among patent applicants with strong collaboration, kinship collab-
oration with investment relationships is dominant; 3) provinces participating in PV technology innovation are 
increasing significantly, the network is more influenced by leading nodes, and the eastern coastal provinces are 
pioneers in the innovation and R&D of PV technology; and 4) PV technological innovation collaboration between 
patent  applicants  and  cities  has  changed  from  local  collaboration  to  cross-regional  collaboration,  high-value 
areas  are  basically  concentrated  in  the  eastern  coastal  region  of  China,  with  scattered  spatial  characteristics, 
and  cross-regional  collaboration  presents  a  “triangular”  spatial  structure,  with  the  Yangtze  River  Delta,  Pearl 
River  Delta,  and  Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei  as  cores.  The  conclusions  can  provide  patent  information  support  for 
scientific  research  on  energy  conservation  and  emission  reduction  to  achieve  low-carbon  goals,  and  can  also 
provide reference for policy formulation of renewable energy development and green development strategies.   

1. Introduction 

As an important strategic emerging industry, the photovoltaic (PV) 
industry is one of the most promising renewable energy industries in the 
world today. The PV industry not only addresses the impending deple-
tion of traditional energy sources but also provides an excellent path to 

solving problems such as global warming and environmental pollution, 
with  its  clean  energy  properties  [1,2,3,4,5].  The  Chinese  government 
attaches great importance to the issue of global climate change and has 
proactively pledged to achieve a carbon peak and carbon neutrality by 
2030  and  2060,  respectively,  demonstrating  the  responsibility  of  a 
major  country  in  addressing  climate  issues  [6].  Solar  energy  is  an

important  kind  of  renewable  energy,  and  one  of  the  fastest  growing 
renewable energy sources, with the advantages of easy installation, easy 
maintenance  and  no  pollution  [7],  which  could  theoretically  meet 
global energy needs [8]. The climate environment and energy crisis have 
greatly  stimulated  China’s  research,  development  and  application  of 
solar energy [9], and the development of the PV industry is considered 
an  important  direction  for  China  to  achieve  green  development  and 
transformation and is also an important tool to achieve the “dual car-
bon” goal [10]. 

PV  technology  is  an  important  technical  way  to  achieve  green 
development, transformation and overtaking. PV patents are innovative 
forms  of  PV  technology,  and  research  on  PV  patents  can  reflect  the 
research and development (R&D) trend of PV technology in a country 
[11].  The  development  of  China’s  PV  industry  is  a  typical  process  of 
technological change in a catching-up economy [12], that is, through 
the initial stage of acquiring foreign technologies, to vertical integration, 
and  investing  in  research  and  development  of  their  own  technology 
catch-up process. Existing researches suggest that although China pre-
fers international cooperation in the mode of technological cooperation 
in the PV industry [13], the total number of multinational patents in this 
field  is  relatively  small  [14],  and  China’s  innovative  capabilities  in 
developing  PV  technologies  are  accumulated  through  domestic  R&D 
activities [15]. Despite the fact that the total number of patents applied 
for Chinese PV technology has ranked first in the world since 2012, the 
Chinese PV industry still has a large gap with developed countries in 
Europe and the United States in terms of fragmented patents and missing 
core patents, e.g., ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) film raw materials [16, 
17,18].  Therefore,  identifying  the  knowledge  base  of  Chinese  indige-
nous PV patents to build patent innovation synergy is a key issue. 

Regarding  the  research  on  PV  industry  technology,  scholars  have 
mainly focused on the importance to economic development [19], how 
to promote technological innovation in the PV industry [20,21], and the 
impact of government policies on PV technology innovation [22,23,24], 
among other aspects. For example [25], explained the future develop-
ment trend of the PV industry and the importance of strengthening PV 
technological innovation, and [26] and [27] propose that the impact of 
government  support  policies  for  PV  technology  on  PV  innovation  is 
obvious, i.e., effective policies can reduce the R&D costs, improve the 
profits,  and  better  promote  the  development  of  enterprises,  but  few 
scholars have studied PVtechnology innovation from the perspective of 
complex networks. 

With regard to complex networks, most scholars mainly build a one- 
mode network to conduct in-depth studies on the trade between coun-
tries  or  regions  [28,29],  economic  ties  [30],  innovative  collaboration 
[31,32,33] and population mobility [34]; however, there is still a large 
gap in the application and depth of research on two-mode networks [35, 
36].  With  the  deepening  of  complex  network  research  and  the 
complexity of real network relationships, the two-mode network formed 
by associations between different types of network nodes has attracted 
increasing attention from scholars [37]. Compared with one-mode net-
works,  two-mode  networks  can  display  the  information  of  different 
types  of  nodes  and  inter-associations  more  abundantly  to  mine  more 
effective information in the network model and avoid a lack of charac-
teristic  information  regarding  the  main  network  structure  [38]. 
Regarding  the  research  on  two-mode  networks,  scholars  have  mainly 
analyzed  the  structural  characteristics  of  networks  and  definitions  of 
networks [39,40]. With the expansion of research, scholars have con-
structed  two-mode  networks  for  different  types  of  subjects,  such  as 
enterprise-city,  actor-movie,  actor-policy,  listed  company-non-listed 
company, and merger and acquisition (M&A) parties-M&A events [41, 
42,43], and used social network analysis to study the network density, 
centrality, core-edge and other aspects of two-mode networks [44,45, 
46]; however, two-mode networks are rarely used in research on inno-
vation networks. 

Regarding  research  on  innovation  networks,  scholars  have  used 
world-renowned patent databases, such as the Derwent World Patents 

Index  (DWPI),  Incopat,  European  Patent  Office  (EPO)  and  literature 
databases such as SCI [47,48,49], and used social network analysis to 
investigate the network centrality and overall network characteristics of 
technological innovation networks in industrial fields [50,51], such as 
new energy vehicles [52], solar cells [53], and biological sciences [54, 
55].  Previous  studies  have  not  sufficiently  addressed  innovation  net-
works from the perspectives of one-mode and two-mode networks; in 
addition, innovation network research has not been widely conducted 
on PV technology. 

In view of this, the Incopat global patent database of Chinese local PV 
technology  patent  data  to  construct  a  mapping  of  the  evolution  of 
China’s  PV  technology  innovation  network  over  the  past  20  years. 
Specifically, we want to answer the following questions: what are the 
basic  characteristics  of  China’s  innovation network  in  the  field  of PV 
technology? What is the evolutionary trajectory? And what is the cor-
relation  between  provincial  spaces?  The  potential  marginal  contribu-
tions  are:  the  dual  perspectives  of  one-mode  and  two-mode  network 
break  the  limitation  of  the  single-element  perspective  of  traditional 
factor network research, and also make up for the lack of information 
caused by the single perspective, deepen the idea of evolutionary eco-
nomics, and enrich the content of innovation linkage network analysis. 
In  practical  level,  exploring  the  spatial  situation  of  China’s  PV  tech-
nology  innovation  collaboration  to  identify  problems  from  a  novel 
perspective, helping to clarify China’s current PV technology accumu-
lation pattern. In addition, an in-depth analysis of the network pattern 
evolution  of  PV  technology  innovation  networks  at  different  spatial 
scales  could  promote  the  innovation  and  development  of  China’s  PV 
industry and provide suggestions for overcoming the shortcomings of PV 
technology,  achieving  technological  breakthroughs  in  core  areas,  and 
promoting the development of China’s PV industry. 

2. Research data and methods 

2.1. Research data 

The data used in this study were obtained from the Incopat global 
patent database. Drawing on the research methods of previous scholars 
and using the International Patent Classification (IPC) green patent code 
[56], PV-related IPC patents in the Incopat global patent database were 
searched.1  First, the patents that are not related to PV were excluded, 
and  second,  patents  with  a  single  applicant,  natural  persons  or  com-
panies registered outside China were excluded. In total, 6206 patents in 
the  past  20  years,  i.e.,  from  2002  to  2021,  met  the  inclusion  re-
quirements. For the calculation of patent collaboration, first and nonfirst 
patent  applicants  were  distinguished,  and  collaboration  was  divided 
into the first patent applicant (initiating) and the nonfirst patent appli-
cant  (participating),  forming  a  directed  data  matrix  of  collaborative 
innovation among patent applicants. If a patent was applied for by four 
patent applicants A, B, C, and D, the collaborations between A and B, A 
and C, and A and D were all counted (3 times). To show the evolution 
characteristics of the PV technology innovation network as objectively 
as possible and to avoid sudden changes caused by special circumstances 
within  a  certain  year,  a  multiple  stage  method  was  adopted,  i.e.,  the 
research  period  was  divided  into  four  stages:  2002–2006  (Stage  I), 
2007–2011 (Stage II), 2012–2016 (Stage III) and 2017–2021 (Stage IV).
