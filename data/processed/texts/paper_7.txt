1. Introduction 

This research explores the effects of the green bonds market on resource efficiency across 12 actively involved 
Asian economies from 2015 to 2022. The empirical results indicate a positive connection between green bond 
issuance and resource efficiency, suggesting that a 1% increase in green bonds corresponds to significant short- 
term (0.33%) and long-term (0.43%) improvements. Surprisingly, a negative relationship is observed between 
GDP growth and resource efficiency, implying that economic expansion may contribute to heightened resource 
consumption. The study highlights the favorable impact of renewable power generation on resource efficiency, 
driven by the sustainability of renewable energy sources. Nevertheless, challenges arise from poverty ratios and 
consumer price indices, impeding the adoption of resource-efficient technology. Furthermore, while cell phone 
penetration initially benefits resource efficiency, a negative correlation emerges in the long term due to increased 
non-renewable  energy  consumption.  In  light  of  these  findings,  the  study  recommends  practical  policies  for 
sustainable  development,  including  actively  promoting  the  green  bonds  market,  targeted  investments  in 
renewable energy, and initiatives to address economic disparities while encouraging resource-efficient practices.   

The urgent threat posed by climate change serves as a compelling call 
for  global  action.  In  the  aftermath  of  the  pandemic,  a  distinctive  op-
portunity emerges in the form of a green recovery (Zachariadis et al., 
2023). This approach not only addresses the economic and social chal-
lenges exacerbated by the pandemic but also paves the way toward a 
sustainable future. Essential to this initiative is the adoption of a process 
that transitions towards a low-carbon footprint. By investing in renew-
able energy, sustainable infrastructure, and green technologies, societies 
can  simultaneously  stimulate  economic  growth,  create  employment 
opportunities,  and  mitigate  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change 
(Briggs et al., 2022; Saboori et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023). This pivotal 
moment requires international collaboration, forward-thinking policies, 
and a shared commitment to usher in an era characterized by resilience 
and  sustainability,  prioritizing  the  well-being  of  the  planet  and  its 
inhabitants. 

Recognizing the paramount importance of financing the transition to 
a low-carbon paradigm is essential in confronting the urgent challenges 

posed by climate change. Adequate funding for this shift towards a low- 
carbon portfolio is the key to unlocking a sustainable future (Hu et al., 
2023; Cheng et al., 2023). The magnitude of this transformation requires 
substantial investments in clean energy, sustainable transportation, and 
eco-friendly  technologies.  By  directing  financial  resources  into  these 
initiatives, we can not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also 
foster innovation and drive economic growth (Ren et al., 2023; Su et al., 
2023). The financial sector plays a critical role in mobilizing capital for 
environmentally  responsible  projects,  expediting  the  transition  to  a 
low-carbon economy. Gao and Chen (2023) assert that, at this pivotal 
moment  in  the  battle  against  climate  change,  allocating  financial  re-
sources to this cause is not merely an investment in the environment but 
also  a  testament  to  a  commitment  to  safeguard  the  planet  for  future 
generations. 

Green bonds serve as crucial mechanisms for financing the shift to a 
low-carbon portfolio and advancing sustainable development (Tu et al., 
2020). Its market size has expanded from over 37 billion USD in 2014 to 
over 487.1 billion USD in 2022, expected to reach 914.4 billion USD by 
2030.  These  financial  instruments  are  intricately  crafted  to  generate

capital  for  projects  that yield  environmental  benefits.  Specifically,  Ye 
and Rasoulinezhad (2023) express that green bonds provide investors 
with the means to champion initiatives like renewable energy projects, 
energy-efficient building endeavors, and the establishment of sustain-
able transportation systems. By directing funds toward these environ-
mentally  responsible  projects,  green  bonds  establish  a  tangible 
connection between financial investments and positive environmental 
outcomes  (Li  et  al.,  2023).  These  instruments  not  only  serve  as  a 
financial tool but also act as a catalyst for promoting eco-friendly en-
deavors  on  a  broader  scale.  The  issuance  and  uptake  of  green  bonds 
contribute  to  the  overall  momentum  in  fostering  environmentally 
conscious  Ye  and  Rasoulinezhad  (2023)investments,  thereby  encour-
aging  the  development  of  innovative  solutions  to  address  pressing 
environmental  challenges  (Rasoulinezhad,  2022).  In  doing  so,  green 
bonds  play  a  dual  role  in  shaping  a  sustainable  future  –  not  only  by 
providing financial support to green projects but also by influencing a 
shift in investment behavior towards projects that align with ecological 
sustainability.  n  recent  times,  there  has  been  a  notable  surge  in  the 
issuance of green bonds by corporate entities. The proportion of total 
corporate bonds designated as green increased significantly, rising from 
4.7% in 2020 to 8.3% in 2021 and further to 11.0% in 2022 (Adekoya 
et al., 2023). The collective issuance of green bonds in Asia and Australia 
demonstrated  growth,  reaching  $33.15  billion  in  the  first  quarter, 
compared to the previous year’s $32.28 billion. A substantial portion of 
this increase can be attributed to the issuance of $5.50 billion in green 
bonds by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. India also experienced 
an  uptick  in  issuance,  marking  a  34.6%  increase  to  $2.06  billion. 
Notably, China emerged as the primary source of green bonds in 2022, 
recording a significant figure of USD 85.4 billion (RMB 575.2 billion) 
according to Climate Bonds Initiative (2022). 

Financing  projects  related  to  resource  efficiency  is  of  paramount 
importance in light of the environmental consequences triggered by the 
overconsumption  of  natural  resources.  The  relentless  exploitation  of 
resources,  driven by  growing global  demands,  has led to  a  myriad  of 
ecological  challenges  such  as  deforestation,  depletion  of  biodiversity, 
and the exacerbation of climate change (Li et al., 2023). These adverse 
effects  underscore  the  urgency  of  adopting  sustainable  practices  that 
prioritize  resource  efficiency.  According  to  Zhao  and  Rasoulinezhad 
(2023),  by  directing  financial  support  towards  projects  aimed  at 
enhancing resource efficiency, we can address the root causes of envi-
ronmental degradation. These projects may encompass innovations in 
recycling  technologies,  sustainable  agricultural  practices,  and  the 
development  of  circular  economy  models.  Investing  in  resource  effi-
ciency  not  only  mitigates  environmental  harm  but  also  promotes 
long-term resilience by ensuring the responsible and sustainable use of 
finite  resources  (Yao  et  al.,  2023).  In  essence,  financing  projects  in 
resource efficiency is a strategic investment in the health of our planet, 
fostering a balance between human needs and the preservation of our 
precious natural resources for generations to come. 

This study centers on a key research question, examining how the 
expansion of the green bonds market can act as a catalyst in promoting 
resource efficiency. The central hypothesis suggests that with the growth 
of the green bonds market, there will be a noticeable increase in funding 
for  projects  specifically  aimed  at  improving  resource  efficiency.  The 
research  aims  to  empirically  investigate  this  hypothesis  through  a 
comprehensive analysis focused on selected Asian countries. To assess 
this  hypothesis,  the  paper  will  conduct  an  empirical  exploration,  uti-
lizing data and case studies to scrutinize the relationship between the 
expansion of the green bonds market and the advancement of resource 
efficiency initiatives. 

The  decision  to  focus  on  Asian  economies  is  motivated  by  the  re-
gion’s  dynamic  economic  landscape,  rapid  industrialization,  and  the 
consequential strain on natural resources. By examining resource effi-
ciency in Asian economies, the research aims not only to contribute to 
the global discourse on sustainable finance but also to provide insights 
into the distinctive challenges and opportunities in a region that holds a 

pivotal role in the global economy. The motivations behind this study 
are grounded in the necessity to foster sustainable development prac-
tices,  address  environmental  concerns,  and  promote  responsible 
resource utilization in a region that wields significant influence on the 
global stage. 

This study yields significant insights into the relationship between 
green bonds and resource efficiency, with a specific emphasis on Asian 
economies.  Firstly,  by  investigating  how  the  expansion  of  the  green 
bonds market can stimulate resource efficiency initiatives, the research 
offers valuable perspectives on the role of financial instruments in pro-
pelling sustainability practices. The empirical exploration, focusing on a 
set of Asian countries, enriches existing literature by providing region- 
specific insights, recognizing the diverse economic and environmental 
landscapes within Asia. Moreover, the study advances our understand-
ing  of  the  practical  implications  of  green  bonds  in  fostering  resource 
efficiency  projects,  offering  evidence-based  guidance  for  sustainable 
finance strategies to policymakers and financial institutions. Addition-
ally, the research illuminates the motivations behind studying resource 
efficiency in Asian economies, acknowledging the region’s pivotal role 
in  the  global  economy  and  the  associated  environmental  challenges. 
Ultimately,  this  study  contributes  not  only  to  academic  discourse  but 
also  to  real-world  applications,  deepening  our  understanding  of  how 
financial instruments can be harnessed to address urgent environmental 
concerns within the distinctive context of Asian economies. 

The remaining sections of the paper are strategically structured to 
adeptly tackle the research objectives. Section 2 meticulously delves into 
the  literature  gap,  providing  a  thorough  review  of  pertinent  studies. 
Shifting  the  focus  to  the  transmission  channels  through  which  green 
bonds influence resource efficiency, Section 3 offers a detailed exami-
nation. Following this, Section 4 presents the empirical findings derived 
from the study. Finally, Section 5 serves as the conclusion, summarizing 
the key insights and implications drawn from the research. This orga-
nizational  framework  ensures  a  cohesive  and  logical  progression 
through the paper’s exploration of the relationship between green bonds 
and resource efficiency. 

2. Literature gap 

A comprehensive review of prior studies is essential to identify gaps 
in the literature and underscore the novel contributions of the present 
paper. This critical examination allows for a thorough understanding of 
the  existing  research  landscape  and  the  identification  of  areas  where 
further investigation is warranted. In this context, the following main-
streams  of  literature  are  presented  based  on  the  existing  body  of 
knowledge. 

The current literature places a strong emphasis on the imperative of 
pursuing sustainability and transitioning to a green economy, indicating 
a  heightened  awareness  of  the  urgent  need  to  address  environmental 
challenges and cultivate long-term economic resilience. Buonocore and 
Pettoello-Mantovani’s  study  (Buonocore  and  Pettoello-  Mantovani, 
2023)  highlighted  the  economic  repercussions  of  climate  change, 
emphasizing the potential for severe disruptions and economic losses if 
sustainable practices are not adopted. Additionally, Wang et al.’s work 
(Wang et al., 2023) underscored the importance of incorporating envi-
ronmental considerations into business practices for sustained viability. 
In the financial sector, research by Dmuchowski et al. (2023) showcased 
the  business  case  for  sustainability,  illustrating  that  companies  with 
robust  environmental, social,  and  governance (ESG)  practices tend  to 
outperform  their  counterparts.  Furthermore,  the  concept  of  a  green 
economy, as articulated by Mealy and Teytelboym (2022), advocates for 
a  paradigm  shift  towards  environmentally  sustainable  practices, 
emphasizing the interconnectedness of economic, social, and environ-
mental  dimensions.  This  collective  body  of  literature  reflects  a 
comprehensive  acknowledgment  of  the  intertwined  relationship  be-
tween  environmental  responsibility  and  economic  success  in  contem-
porary discourse.
