Abstract: Nano and single-atom catalysis open new possibilities of producing green hydrogen (H2) by water electrolysis.
However, for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which occurs at a characteristic reaction rate proportional to the
potential, the fast generation of H2 nanobubbles at atomic-scale interfaces often leads to the blockage of active sites.
Herein, a nanoscale grade-separation strategy is proposed to tackle mass-transport problem by utilizing ordered three-
dimensional (3d) interconnected sub-5 nm pores. The results reveal that 3d criss-crossing mesopores with grade
separation allow efficient diffusion of H2 bubbles along the interconnected channels. After the support of ultrafine
ruthenium (Ru), the 3d mesopores are on a superior level to two-dimensional system at maximizing the catalyst
performance and the obtained Ru catalyst outperforms most of the other HER catalysts. This work provides a potential
route to fine-tuning few-nanometer mass transport during water electrolysis.

Introduction

Electrochemical water splitting powered by renewables
opens numerous possibilities for scalable production of
green hydrogen.[1] To improve electrolyzer efficiency, the
cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) requires an
electrocatalyst that allows not only the efficient reduction of
protons to H2 but also the facile detachment of H2 bubbles
from the surface to avoid their blockage of the active
sites.[2, 3] These two requirements become crucial, when
water electrolysis cells operate at A cm(cid:0) 2.[4] Therefore, the
rational design of HER catalysts brings practical meaning to
producing hydrogen from water.[5]

Over a decade of effort by scientists have been expended
on this goal, with much of that focused on increasing the

heterostructure.[10] However, controlling mass transport at
the solid–liquid–gas interface of H2 evolution is more
challenging, and does not advance as far.[11] Compared with
gas-concentration-limited cathodic reactions (for example,
the reduction of O2 and CO2), the HER possesses a much
greater reaction rate by several orders of magnitude.[12] For
an active catalyst, the fast generation of H2 may form plenty
of gas bubbles attached on the catalyst surface, which block
the active sites[13] and enlarge the ohmic resistance of the
electrolyte,[14]
leading to voltage loss in electrolyzer. Re-
cently, some electrode structures featuring a superaeropho-
bic surface and good electrolyte wettability were well
designed—catalyst-coated membranes,[15]

layers,[16] nanoarrays,[17] and macroporous frameworks[18]—to
growth and accelerate detachment,
minimize bubble
although they usually failed to regulating mass transport at
the nanometer scale (Figure 1).[19] When metal catalysts are
downsized to a few nanometers, even to the single-atom
limit,[20]
the above-mentioned structures cannot provide
matching transport channels for the ultrasmall nanobubbles
generated by electrolysis at atomic-scale interfaces.[21] The
low transport efficiency, in turn, limits the practicalities of
nano-and single-atom catalysts for HER.[22] Consequently,
developing a new strategy to achieve few-nanometer con-
fined mass transport is urgently required.[23]

Herein, we propose a nanoscale grade-separation strat-
egy to achieve confined mass transport at the few-nano-
meter through utilization of ordered three-dimensional (3d)
interconnected sub-5 nm pores (rightmost panel of Fig-
ure 1). Specifically, two types of catalyst carbon supports
were synthesized that showed either two-dimensional (2d)
hexagonal (p6m) or 3d cubic (Im�3m) ordered mesopores of

about 4–5 nm width (named 2d-OMC and 3d-OMC). The
pores below 5 nm perfectly match the size of nanobubbles
that evolve on few-nanometer catalysts. In 2d-OMC, the
mesopore channels are parallel to each other over long
distances, through which gas bubbles can only diffuse out in
the axial direction. But, 3d-OMC is a lattice of criss-crossing
pores with grade separation in three dimensions, which is
similar to grade-separated junctions in urban and rural
areas, thus allowing bubbles to move freely along these
interconnected channels, with fewer interruptions, and at
higher overall transport rates. After ultrafine ruthenium
(Ru) being supported on, the 3d arrangement of pores was,
indeed, on a superior level
to 2d system in transport
efficiency for H2; Ru/3d-OMC exhibits an over twofold
improvement in catalytic activity than that of Ru/2d-OMC,
even outperforming most other state-of-the-art HER cata-
lysts. Our comparative study deepens our understanding on
few-nanometer mass transport during water electrolysis, and
offers a promising strategy how to control it.

Results and Discussion

Our strategy for preparing Ru/3d-OMC involves surfactant-
templated self-assembly,
in which F127 (poly(ethylene
oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethyleneoxide) triblock
copolymer) acts as a structure-directing agent
for the
condensation of organic species. In this system, hexameth-
ylenetetramine (HMT) can decompose into formaldehyde
and ammonia, and 3-aminophenol possesses strong hydro-
gen-bond interaction with F127. Therefore, F127 can be
combined with formaldehyde and 3-aminophenol using an
organic sol–gel process to form a self-ordered 3-amino-
phenol-formaldehyde/F127 product (APF/F127) (Figure S1).
Next, the as-synthesized APF/F127 was redispersed in an
aqueous solution of RuCl3 at room temperature, and the
Ru3 + ions can be trapped by rich nitrogen (N)-containing
organo-functional groups in APF. Subsequent carbonization
and removal of F127 templates yielded Ru/3d-OMC with
ordered 3d interconnected mesopores and uniform disper-
structures
sion of ultrafine Ru particles. Mesoporous

fabricated using such a soft-template possess stable cylin-
for the
drical mesopore channels, which are beneficial
smooth mass transfer of H2. Ru/2d-OMC was synthesized
under similar conditions, except an amount of 1,3,5-triethyl-
benzene (TMB) was added in the cooperative self-assembly
process. TMB tends to distribute in the hydrophobic regions
of polymeric micelles, leading to the decrease of the hydro-
philic/hydrophobic volume ratio and the interfacial curva-
ture. When the balance of hydrophilic/hydrophobic is
achieved, a transformation of mesoporous structure from Im
�3m to p6m occurs (Figure S2). According to the scanning
electron microscope (SEM) images, one could observe that
the Ru/2d-OMC possessed rod-like morphologies (Fig-
ure S3) whereas Ru/3d-OMC exhibited irregular shapes with
particle sizes range from hundreds of nanometers to micro-
meters (Figure S4).

To further investigate mesopore structures, Ru/2d-OMC
and Ru/3d-OMC were characterized through small-angle X-
ray scattering (SAXS) patterns.[24] As shown in Figure 2a,
the SAXS pattern of Ru/2d-OMC showed three peaks,
which could be attributed to (10), (11), and (20) reflections,
revealing the typical 2d hexagonal symmetry of Ru/2d-
OMC. The position of the strong (10) peak indicated a d-
spacing of 10.2 nm, corresponding to a unit cell parameter of
11.8 nm, which was calculated according to the Formulas (1)
and (2):

The SAXS pattern of Ru/3d-OMC exhibited one intense
peak of (110) and two weak peaks of (200) and (211), which
was coincident with the typical features of body-centered
cubic structure. The lattice d-spacing of Ru/3d-OMC and
corresponding unit cell parameter was calculated to be
8.7 nm and 12.3 nm, respectively, according to the Formu-
las (3) and (4):
