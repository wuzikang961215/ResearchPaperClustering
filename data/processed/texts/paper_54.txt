Abstract—This document is on the design and testing of a grid-
scale Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) employing Virtual
Synchronous Generator (VSG) control grid-forming scheme.
The BESS is rated 60 MWh/50 MW. The simulations were
conducted using MATLAB/Simulink/Simscape software. The pro-
tection functions and the associated protection relays needed to
achieve these functionalities are presented. The approach adopted
can apply to any relevant standard or grid code associated with
a Transmission System Operator (TSO) internationally, however,
the local grid codes in the context of South Africa were used.
The system is designed to be compliant with the document
Grid Connection Code for Battery Energy Storage Facilities
(BESF) connected to the Electricity Transmission System (TS)
or the Distribution System (DS) in South Africa and is classified
under Category C as defined in the same document. The system
was able to adjust both its active and reactive power outputs
accordingly in response to load reduction conditions in the
network. Furthermore, for local fault conditions,
it was able
to ride-through transient faults and trip and disconnect for
permanent faults. For these two cases the BESS protection
functionality serves as primary protection. The system was also
able to trip and disconnect for remote permanent faults where
the associated protection functionality is utilised as back-up
protection.

I. INTRODUCTION

Power grids worldwide are undergoing a major transition
from the synchronous generator dominated technology asso-
ciated with fossil-fuel generators to generation and storage
technology based on Inverter Based Resources (IBRs). BESS
is meant to play an integral role in mitigating the intermittency
associated with large-scale solar and wind power generation
plants. There are numerous grid-forming techniques in the
literature, however, the focus of this work shall be on Virtual
Synchronous Generator (VSG) technology. Models in both
Root Mean Squared (RMS) (phasor) and Electro-Magnetic
Transient (EMT)-based simulation software packages are in-
creasingly becoming important tools in the field of power

systems. These models are important for grid-integration stud-
ies in order to assess the stability of newly-built or modified
components of the grid such as generators and BESS.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW

In [1], Vilmann et al investigated the stability of wind farms
when they are integrated into parts of the grid considered
weak. The frequency and voltage compliance capabilities of
three grid-forming techniques namely: droop control, Virtual
Synchronous Machine (VSM) and synchronverter were inves-
tigated and benchmarked. The procedure followed was that of
quantifying the performance during a contingency of a fre-
quency disturbance, with sensitivity to the Short Circuit Ratio
(SCR), X/R ratio and the inertia constant H. The conclusion
of the investigation was that the VSM is the most compliant
grid-forming control technique. In [2], Sang et al reviewed
the history of some of the common grid-forming control tech-
nologies which are the VSG and the synchronverter. Detailed
descriptions of the two is outlined in [3] and [4] respectively.
In [5], Alsokhiry et al investigated the limitations of Voltage
Source Converters (VSC) in weak AC grids from a voltage
stability point of view. The conclusion from the analysis was
that the maximum active power that the VSC can exchange
with a weak AC grid is determined by voltage stability limits.
The simulations were conducted using MATLAB/Simulink.
In [6], a comprehensive review of grid-forming pilot projects
and demonstrations that have been implemented worldwide
was undertaken. The projects include BESS, HVDC systems,
wind farms and hybrid plants. A comparison study was also
undertaken where the similarities and differences between
the projects were highlighted. A similar review of grid-scale
BESS grid-forming projects, already in deployment or under
construction worldwide, was conducted and listed in [7]. In
[8] Minnaar et al
investigated issues of power quality as
pertains to grid code compliance in South Africa, with a
focus on harmonic emissions. However, there was not much

focus on BESS technology in particular and no conduction of
simulations to test for grid code compliance. The authors in [9]
also looked into technicalities of grid codes and compared the
South African grid code for Renewable Power Plants (RPPs)
to those of other Transmission System Operators (TSOs) that
operate within other countries with a main focus on European
countries. The TSOs include Energinet in Denmark, EirGrid
in Ireland and SONI in Northern Ireland, National Grid in
the United Kingdom and TenneT in Germany. However, there
were no simulations undertaken in order to evaluate the
dynamic performance of the RPPs or BESS against grid code
compliance for any of the TSOs.
There has been limited studies in performance evaluation of
grid-forming BESS for grid code compliance in weak grids
both internationally and locally, in the context of the grid in
South Africa. This paper seeks to fill in this gap.

III. METHODOLOGY

Fig. 2. Control block for implementation of P-f droop, inertia and damping
for the BESS inverter

Fig. 1 shows the single line diagram of the network used
in the investigation. The SCR at the grid interface point is
3, which corresponds to a weak grid condition. The core
control module for the VSG is shown in Fig. 2. It includes
damping, with the corresponding damping constant denoted
by the letter D, active power vs frequency droop constant
denoted by the letter Kp and inertia constant denoted by the
letter H. Other control blocks such as those that implement

reactive power vs voltage droop are not shown. All the inverter
control techniques are implemented in the direct-quadrature-
zero (dq0) domain. The Park Transformation is utilised to
transform the network variables from the conventional three-
phase abc reference frame to the dq0 rotating reference frame,
and the inverse Park Transformation is utilised to re-transform
them after control and manipulation.
For the overall control loops the cascaded voltage and current
control technique was implemented and extensive explanation
of the comprehensive VSG control loops is documented in
[2]. In cases where the local grid code does not exist or
is underdeveloped, international standards such as the IEEE
Standard for Interconnection and Interoperability of Inverter-
Interconnecting with Associated
Based Resources (IBRs)
Transmission Electric Power Systems (IEEE 2800-2022), or
other well-developed grid codes such as that for National
Grid in the United Kingdom, can be used as a guideline
for testing for compliance. However, for the focus of this
particular investigation the South African grid code document
for BESS compliance is well-developed enough to be used
as a guideline. The base values for the per unit system are
derived from a 50 MVA base and a base voltage of 0.69 kV.
