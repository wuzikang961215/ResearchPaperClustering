Powered  by  renewable  energy  sources  such  as  solar,  marine,  geothermal  and  wind,  generation  of  storable  hydrogen  fuel 
through  water  electrolysis  provides  a  promising  path  towards  energy  sustainability.  However,  state-of-the-art  electrolysis 
requires support from associated processes such as desalination of water sources, further purification of desalinated water, 
and transportation of water, which often contribute financial and energy costs. One strategy to avoid these operations is to 
develop electrolysers that are capable of operating with impure water feeds directly. Here we review recent developments in 
electrode materials/catalysts for water electrolysis using low-grade and saline water, a significantly more abundant resource 
worldwide  compared  to  potable  water.  We  address  the  associated  challenges  in  design  of  electrolysers,  and  discuss  future 
potential  approaches  that  may  yield  highly  active  and  selective  materials  for  water  electrolysis  in  the  presence  of  common 
impurities such as metal ions, chloride and bio-organisms.

Freshwater is likely to become a scarce resource for many com-

munities, with more than 80% of the world’s population exposed 
to high risk levels of water security1. This has been recognized 
within the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) on Clean Water 
and  Sanitation2.  At  the  same  time,  low-grade  and  saline  water  is  a 
largely abundant resource which, used properly, can address SDG 7 
on Affordable and Clean Energy as well as SDG 13 on Climate Action.
Hydrogen, a storable fuel, can be generated through water elec-
trolysis  and  it  may  provide  headway  towards  combating  climate 
change and reaching zero emissions3, since the cycle of generation, 
consumption  and  regeneration  of  hydrogen  can  achieve  carbon 
neutrality. In addition to providing a suitable energy store, hydro-
gen can be easily distributed and used in industry, households and 
transport.  Hydrogen,  and  the  related  fuel  cell  industry,  has  the 
potential  to  bring  positive  economic  and  social  impacts  to  local 
communities in terms of energy efficiency and job markets; glob-
ally the hydrogen market is expected to grow 33% to US$155 bil-
lion in 20224. However, there are remaining challenges related to the 
minimization of the cost and integration of hydrogen into daily life, 
as well as meeting the ultimate hydrogen cost targets of <US$2 kg–1 
set by the US Department of Energy5–7.

Commercially available water electrolysers operate with support 
from  ancillary  components/equipment8,9.  The  high  purity  water 
feeds are achieved by incorporating extensive water purification sys-
tems into the overall electrolyser design (internal) or via pre-treat-
ment  using  external  purification/desalination  plants.  Desalination 
and subsequent purification, and the associated investment costs for 
plantation, land, maintenance and transportation, therefore impose 
considerable  costs.  Several  techno-economic  studies  have  been 
published in the past few years10,11, however, a more comprehensive 
review with up-to-date costs is still needed. Desalination costs vary 
considerably  depending  on  the  price  of  electricity,  and  increase  if 
intermittent renewable sources are used12. Nevertheless, the cost of 
water  purification  systems  remains  significant12.  Particular  inter-
est in direct saline water electrolysis exists for off-shore large-scale 
hydrogen  production,  a  sector  where  the  capital  costs  are  domi-
nated by the footprint of the installation, and the simplification in 

engineering by removing pre-treatment systems would have a great 
impact on the economic viability of such installations3.

A route to reduce cost would be to use low-grade or saline water 
directly  through  development  of  efficient  and  selective  catalytic 
electrode  materials  and  the  utilization  of  effective  membranes  in 
the electrolysers that are suitable for impure water. Therefore, ideal 
catalytic electrode materials and membranes should be able to deal 
with  competing  redox  reactions  at  both  electrodes,  complications 
related to membrane function, reactor degradation and biofouling. 
Here  we  review  key  issues  and  recent  research  in  electrolysis  and 
the development of electrode materials/catalysts targeting direct use 
of low-grade and saline water in the electrolysis processes. In addi-
tion, we address the major aspects in the design of electrolysers for 
hydrogen generation.

Challenges of saline water electrolysis
Splitting  water  into  oxygen  and  hydrogen  is  an  energetically  uphill 
chemical process where an external energy source is required to drive 
the reaction. In an electrolyser, electricity is converted to, and stored in 
the form of, chemical bonds. The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) 
at the cathode is a two electron-proton reaction, which can be formu-
lated as Eqs. (1) or (2) under acidic or alkaline conditions, respectively.

The counter reaction at the anode, the oxygen evolution reaction 
(OER),  is  a  multi-electron  transferring  process,  involving  several 
intermediates and the removal of four protons per oxygen molecule 
evolved. It can be described by Eqs. (3) or (4) in acidic or alkaline 
environments, respectively.

Review ARticlehttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-020-0550-8Catalysts are usually either deposited onto the current collector 
electrodes  (catalyst  coated  electrode,  CCE)  or  are  coated  directly 
onto  the  ion  exchange  membranes  (catalyst  coated  membrane, 
CCM) to facilitate the water splitting reactions. An important cata-
lytic activity metric is the difference between the applied potential at 
a given current density and the half-reaction standard potential; the 
so called overpotential (ɳ). This difference characterizes the extra 
energy  taken  to  push  the  half  reaction  significantly  forward  from 
the thermodynamic zero net-current equilibrium point13. The com-
plexity of the OER requires a large overpotential, even with state-of-
the-art catalysts and especially when compared to the HER.

Water  electrolysis  typically  requires  ultra-purified  water,  either 
directly  in  membrane  electrolysers  (proton  exchange  membrane 
water  electrolysers,  PEMWE;  anion  exchange  membrane  water 
electrolysers, AEMWE) or in a mixture with salts for alkaline water 
electrolysers  (AWE).  The  key  challenges  in  the  direct  electroly-
sis  of  saline  water  have  long  been  identified  and  discussed14,  and 
remain major issues today. Although carbonates in seawater (saline 
water)  can  act  as  buffers,  the  capacity  is  not  high  enough  to  pre-
vent increases in the local pH at the cathode and decreases in the 
local pH at the anode. Studies showed changes in pH near the elec-
trode surface could be on the order of 5–9 pH units from that of 
the bulk seawater, for a slightly buffered medium when its overall 
pH value is in between 4 and 10, even at moderate current densities 
<10 mA cm–2(ref.  15–17). Such dramatic pH fluctuations may cause 
catalyst  degradation.  Local  pH  increases  near  the  cathode  during 
seawater (not artificially buffered) electrolysis can lead to precipita-
tion of magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2), which occurs when pH 
≥ ~9.5(ref. 18), blocking the cathode14,19. Stabilization of pH fluctua-
tions may require the addition of supporting electrolytes20,21.

Other  challenges  include  the  presence  of  non-innocent  ions 
(both  anions  and  cations)17,22  and  bacteria/microbes23,  as  well  as 
small  particulates,  all  of  which  may  poison  electrodes/catalysts 
and  limit  their  long-term  stability.  This  challenge  also  extends  to 
the membranes used for the separation of the anode and cathode24. 
Another key issue to consider is the competition between the OER 
and chloride chemistry at the anode.

Chloride electro-oxidation chemistry is complicated and several 
reactions occur depending on the pH values, potentials applied and 
temperature.  If,  for  simplicity,  we  consider  the  temperature  of  25 
°C  and  fix  the  total  concentration  of  chlorine  species  to  0.5  M  (a 
typical chloride concentration for seawater), a Pourbaix diagram for 
aqueous chloride chemistry can be constructed as shown in Fig. 117.
When the pH is below 3.0 the free chlorine evolution reaction 
(ClER, Eq. 5) dominates over the other chloride oxidation reactions 
(Fig. 1). Hypochlorous acid formation might also occur at lower pH 
at high anodic potentials, but becomes the major reaction for pH 
3–7.5. Hypochlorite formation takes place at pH values higher than 
7.5 (Eq. 6), which represents the pKa of hypochlorous acid. Partial 
dissociations  (that  is,  chlorine  dissolved  in  water)  and  dispropor-
tionation  (that  is,  hypochlorite  ions  subjected  to  higher  tempera-
ture) complicate the chemistry of chlorine species. At the two pH 
extremes the two chloride oxidation reactions are:

Fig. 1 | The Pourbaix diagram of an aqueous saline electrolyte. 
Represented is the electrode potential versus pH diagram, it provides 
information of the stability of an aqueous 0.5 M NaCl electrolyte, including 
the H2O/O2 and the Cl–/Cl2/HOCl/ClO– redox couples. The diagram 
depicts potential–pH regions where the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) 
and the chloride oxidation reactions are thermodynamically possible. 
The green line represents the thermodynamic equilibrium between water 
and oxygen. at electrode potentials more positive than the green line, the 
OER process becomes thermodynamically possible. The red line shows 
the competing acidic oxidation of chloride to free gaseous chlorine. The 
black and purple lines mark the onset of the oxidation of chloride to 
hypochlorous acid, HClO, or hypochlorite, ClO–. The potential difference 
between the chloride chemistry and the water oxidation is maximized to 
480 mV in alkaline media pH > 7.5 (light blue region), where chloride 
is oxidized to ClO–. SHE, standard hydrogen electrode. adapted with

the hypochlorite formation starts, where it remains at its maximum 
value of ~480 mV (ref. 17). In other words, under alkaline conditions 
a water oxidation catalyst can exhibit up to 480 mV kinetic overpo-
tential without any interfering chlorine chemistry. This is known as 
the ‘alkaline design criterion’ in saline water electrolysis17, because 
the  requirements  for  the  catalytic  activity  of  the  OER  catalyst  are 
least stringent in this region.

It is worth noting that both chloride reactions (Eqs. (5) and (6)) 
are two-electron reactions, in contrast with the OER in which four 
electrons are involved. This difference in the numbers of electrons 
involved in the mechanisms (Eq. (2) versus Eq. (4)) give rise to the 
commonly  observed  higher  overpotential  for  OER  than  chloride 
oxidation  and  makes  OER  kinetically  unfavourable.  Therefore, 
developing highly selective anode catalysts is essential to avoid the 
evolution of corrosive and toxic chlorine gas during the electrolysis 
of saline water.

Reactor design considerations
Currently  the  two  proven  low-temperature  (<100  °C)  water  elec-
trolyser technologies dominating the commercial market are AWE 
and  PEMWE25.  Other  emerging  technologies  include  low  tem-
perature AEMWE26, as well as high-temperature electrolysis, such 
as proton conducting ceramic electrolysis (~150 °C–400 °C)27 and 
solid oxide electrolysis (~500–800 oC)28. These four configurations 
are depicted in Fig. 2.

These electrolyser technologies use either ultra-pure, deionized 
18.2 MΩ·cm water or 20–30% KOH aqueous solution (AWE) with 
contaminants at and below the ppm level. Such high levels of water 
purity are chosen to avoid complications related to catalyst opera-
tion,  membrane  operation  and  general  component  degradation.
