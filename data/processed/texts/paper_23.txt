This research introduces a stochastic scheduling approach that incorporates risk constraints for an energy hub 
(EH), considering uncertainties related to renewable generation and load demands. The proposed method utilizes 
the  Conditional  Value  at  Risk  (CVaR)  technique  to  assess  and  quantify  risks.  By  striking  a  balance  between 
reducing operational and emissions costs and increasing risk aversion, the approach presents a trade-off. The EH 
comprises  various  components  such  as  a  wind  turbine  (WT),  photovoltaic  (PV)  cells,  a  fuel  cell  power  plant 
(FCPP),  a  combined  heat  and  power  generation  unit  (CHP),  and  plug-in  electric  vehicles  (PEVs).  Uncertain 
variables  encompass  factors  such  as  wind  speed,  solar  irradiation,  different  demands,  and  market  prices.  To 
optimize profits and enhance the consumption curve, demand response programs (DRPs) for electrical, thermal, 
and cooling demands are implemented. To address the uncertainties associated with input random variables, the 
efficient k-means data clustering method is employed. A new slime mold algorithm, based on coughing and chaos 
theory, has been proposed to enhance the problem’s solution. The algorithm incorporates innovative operators to 
improve  its  capabilities.  By  utilizing  the  coughing  mechanism  and  chaos  theory,  the  algorithm  explores  the 
solution space more effectively, resulting in improved outcomes for the problem at hand. The results demonstrate 
significant  flexibility  in  EH  management  and  are  extensively  discussed.  Simulation  results  indicate  that  inte-
grating  PEVs,  FCPP,  and  DRPs  can  lead  to  reductions  of  2  %,  7  %,  and  11  %  in  the  EH’s  operating  costs, 
respectively. Furthermore, considering PEVs, FCPP, and DRPs can improve the EH’s risk cost by 1.98 %, 6.7 %, 
and 10.5 %, respectively. Based on the numerical results, in Case 4 led to a remarkable 12.65 % reduction in 
operational costs while simultaneously achieving a 15.43 % decrease in emission costs, showcasing the effec-
tiveness of the proposed approach in optimizing energy management in an energy hub system.   

1. Introduction 

1-1. Difficulties and goals 

The optimal management of energy hubs (EHs) presents significant 
difficulties and challenges due to the complex and dynamic nature of the 
system. Understanding and addressing these challenges is essential to 
achieve efficient and sustainable energy management [1]. Some of the 
key difficulties and goals in managing EHs include.  

i)  Nonlinear  and  Non-convex  Optimization:  The  operation  and 
control  of  EHs  involve  complex  and  nonlinear  optimization 

problems. The interactions between different energy resources, 
storage  systems,  and  loads  create  intricate  relationships  that 
require  sophisticated  optimization  algorithms  to  find  optimal 
solutions.  Additionally,  the  non-convex  nature  of  the  problem 
further complicates the optimization process [2].  

ii)  Uncertainties in Renewable Generation and Load Demands: EHs 
heavily rely on renewable energy sources, which are inherently 
uncertain and variable [3]. Factors such as weather conditions, 
time  of  day,  and  seasonality  can  significantly  affect  the  avail-
ability and output of renewable energy generation technologies. 
Moreover,  load  demands  can  also  vary  unpredictably,  posing 
challenges in accurately forecasting and managing energy supply 
and demand [4].
