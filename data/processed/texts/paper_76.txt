Abstract: This study delves into power system ﬂexibility, with a keen focus on the integration of
variable renewable electricity generation into power grids. Two scenarios were analyzed. The
base scenario revealed an aging grid, insufﬁcient generation capacity, frequent outages, and little
renewable energy generation (1.9%), along with a signiﬁcant (71.23%) loss of load. In contrast, the
investment scenario presented solutions including raising VRE capacity to 44%, adding 1000 MW
capacity transmission lines, installing 200 MW capacity grid-scale battery storage, and technological
enhancements. These interventions effectively eliminated loss of load, reinforcing energy resilience.
Investments in CCGPP and grid-scale batteries proved instrumental in mitigating the variability
of renewable energy.
Improved transmission promised efﬁcient power exchange and regional
collaboration. The elimination of annualized energy spills and the removal of ramping constraints
marked signiﬁcant strides in enhancing power system ﬂexibility. This research underscores the
pivotal role of grid ﬂexibility in accommodating VRE sources. By implementing the proposed optimal
solutions, Afghanistan can lead the way toward a cleaner, more resilient, and more interconnected
energy future. These ﬁndings offer a replicable framework for addressing similar challenges in
integrating renewable energy sources globally and supporting the transition to sustainable and
reliable energy.

1. Introduction

The global energy outlook is undergoing a monumental shift, driven by the pressing
imperatives of mitigating climate change and fostering sustainable development [1]. As
societies recognize the urgent need to decarbonize their energy sectors, the transition from
fossil fuels to renewable energy sources has taken center stage. This pivotal transition not
only holds the promise of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions but also offers the
opportunity to reshape energy systems in ways that are cleaner, more resilient, and more
conducive to long-term economic growth [2].

Variable renewable energy (VRE) sources such as solar and wind offer a compelling
alternative to conventional fossil fuels [3]. Their inherent abundance, environmental
friendliness, and potential for decentralized energy production have positioned them as
the cornerstones of the global energy transition [4]. Simultaneously, with technological

advancements and falling costs, VRE has emerged as a critical pillar for a sustainable
energy future [5,6].

Among the various forms of renewable energy, solar and wind power stand out
due to their availability, scalability, and potential for widespread implementation [7].
However, the intermittent and variable nature of solar and wind resources introduces
unique challenges to power systems [8]. Unlike conventional power plants, which can
provide consistent power output, solar panels and wind turbines generate electricity based
on weather conditions [9,10]. This intermittency can lead to ﬂuctuations in electricity
supply, posing challenges to grid stability and reliability [11].

Integrating variable renewable-based electricity generation requires a paradigm shift
in power system operation and management [12]. This is where the concept of power
system ﬂexibility comes into play [13]. Flexibility refers to a power system’s ability to
quickly adapt to changes in electricity supply and demand. A ﬂexible power system can
seamlessly accommodate ﬂuctuations in renewable generation, manage energy imbalances,
and maintain grid stability [14]. This dynamic capability is essential for ensuring a smooth
transition to a future dominated by variable renewables [15].

To integrate VRE sources effectively, power systems must adopt a suite of ﬂexibility
options [16], including advanced energy storage systems, demand response mechanisms,
grid upgrades, smart distribution networks, and enhanced forecasting techniques [17].
By leveraging these tools, power systems can absorb excess energy during periods of
high generation and release stored energy when renewable generation is low, effectively
bridging the gaps in supply and demand [18].

Though extensive research has been devoted both to the assessment of VRE integration
into the grid and to power system ﬂexibility, a noticeable research gap exists in concurrently
analyzing both aspects [4]. Although prior studies have delved into isolated facets of power
system ﬂexibility, a lack of comprehensive research addressing all components of the power
system, including generation, transmission, distribution, and energy storage, is evident [13].
This research gap underscores the necessity for a comprehensive inquiry into power system
ﬂexibility in the context of VRE integration, with the overarching objective of pinpointing
optimal ﬂexibility solutions for maintaining power system stability and resilience [2].

The principal aim of this study is to scrutinize the impact of VRE integration on power
system ﬂexibility, with a particular focus on optimizing ﬂexibility across all facets of the
power system. Furthermore, it seeks to assess power system ﬂexibility within an island-
type power system characterized by three nodes, which heavily depends on imported
power and fossil fuels [13].

This research paper aims to address these critical issues within the context of Afghanistan’s
power system [19]. Focusing on the integration of solar and wind energy, we assess the
optimal grid ﬂexibility options that can enable Afghanistan to tap into its renewable energy
potential while maintaining a stable and reliable electricity supply [20]. By simulating
different scenarios using the IRENA FLEXTool, Version 2.0 (April 2020) simulation tool,
we uncover insights into the challenges, opportunities, and strategies for achieving a
sustainable and resilient energy transition [21].

Our study centers on Afghanistan’s power systems and their transition towards a
renewable-based future [22]. By analyzing two scenarios—a representation of the current
state (base scenario) and an optimized ﬂexibility solution (investment scenario)—we con-
tribute not only to the knowledge of VRE integration in Afghanistan but also offer lessons
and methodologies that can be applied in similar contexts worldwide [23]. The ﬁndings of
this research hold implications for policymakers, energy planners, and researchers working
toward sustainable energy futures in both developing and developed nations [24,25].

In the ensuing sections, we delve into Afghanistan’s renewable energy potential,
explore the country’s electricity demand proﬁle, analyze the challenges posed by VRE,
and introduce the IRENA FLEXTool, Version 2.0 (April 2020) as a powerful simulation
instrument [26]. We then present the results of our simulations under both scenarios,
