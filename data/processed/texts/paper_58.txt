Synthesis of green ammonia (NH3) via electrolysis of nitric oxide (NO) is 
extraordinarily sustainable, but multielectron/proton-involved hydrogena-
tion steps as well as low concentrations of NO can lead to poor activities and 
selectivities of electrocatalysts. Herein, it is reported that oxygen-defective 
TiO2 nanoarray supported on Ti plate (TiO2−x/TP) behaves as an efficient cata-
lyst for NO reduction to NH3. In 0.2 m phosphate-buffered electrolyte, such 
TiO2−x/TP shows competitive electrocatalytic NH3 synthesis activity with a 
maximum NH3 yield of 1233.2 µg h−1 cm−2 and Faradaic efficiency of 92.5%. 
Density functional theory calculations further thermodynamically faster 
NO deoxygenation and protonation processes on TiO2−x (101) compared to 
perfect TiO2 (101). And the low energy barrier of 0.7 eV on TiO2−x (101) for the 
potential-determining step further highlights the greatly improved intrinsic 
activity. In addition, a Zn-NO battery is fabricated with TiO2−x/TP and Zn 
plate to obtain an NH3 yield of 241.7 µg h−1 cm−2 while providing a peak 
power density of 0.84 mW cm−2.

world  population  and  it  is  also  currently 
known  as  a  clean,  safe,  and  hydrogen-
rich  energy  carrier  to  decarbonize  the 
future  energy  storage  and  transportation 
process.[1–4]  The  energy-intensive  Haber-
Bosch  method  adopted  by  NH3  synthesis 
industries,  nonetheless,  remains  as  a 
fossil  fuel-based  technology  with  a  sig-
nificant  carbon  footprint.[5]  The  develop-
ment of energy-saving and carbon-neutral 
NH3  synthetic  routes  is  therefore  of  great 
interest.  Electrosynthesis  of  NH3  from 
nitrogen  (N2)  and  water  (H+  in  acids), 
which  can  be  powered  by  green  energy, 
has  aroused  scientists’  interest  as  an 
appealing  and  sustainable  alternative.[6–16] 
However, according to the thermodynamic 
principle,  NN  bond  requires  robust  dis-
sociation  energies  (941  kJ  mol−1),  which 
greatly  limits  the  Faradaic  efficiency  (FE) 
and  NH3  yield.  Moreover,  the  hydrogen 
evolution  catalysis  makes  high-rate  N2-to-NH3  hydrogena-
tion  unrealistic  in  the  aqueous  phase.  Nitric  oxide  (NO)  can 
be  regarded  as  a  suitable  nitrogen  source  for  generating  NH3 
due to easier NO deoxygenation than the NN bond breaking,

NH3  than  that  of  N2  will  make  the  electrochemical  NO  reduc-
tion reaction (NORR) more sustainable and efficient.[17–22] Fur-
thermore,  it  is  believed  that  NO,  a  hazardous  air  contaminant 
widely  present  in  exhaust  gas  from  fossil  fuel  combustion, 
poses a major threat to both human health and ecological bal-
ance.[23]  Hence,  it  is  reasonable  to  abate  waste  NO  to  NH3  by 
electrocatalysis,  which  consumes  less  energy  and  eases  the 
pressures  on  the  environment.  Despite  the  high  reactivity  of 
NO,  the  complex  five-electron-coupled  six-proton  deep  reduc-
tion  to  NH3  and  concurrent  side-product/intermediate  (N2, 
N2O, NH2OH, etc.) formation dramatically lowers NH3 genera-
tion rates.[24,25] The development of genuinely active and NH3-
selective catalysts for NORR would enable the implementation 
of the technology in industries.

Much effort was devoted to ascertaining selectivities of noble 
metals, especially Pt, during the NO electrolysis, yet their NH3 
selectivities  typically  remained  unsatisfactory  because  of  the 
coproduction of other products (N2O or NH2OH).[26–28] Recent 
NORR  catalysts  including  MoS2  nanoarray,[21]  a-B2.6C/TiO2,[29] 
single-atom Nb sites supported on B,N co-doped carbon nano-
tubes (Nb-SA/BNC),[30] Cu foam,[31] etc. can selectively produce 
NH3  from  NO,  but  metal  complexes  to  increase  the  solubility 
of  NO  or  high-purity  of  NO  are  needed  for  enhanced  perfor-
mance.  Encouragingly,  TiO2,  one  of  the  cheapest,  most  ecof-
riendly,  and  highly  durable  materials,  is  seen  as  a  promising 
electrode  material  for  electrocatalysis.[32–38]  Notably,  limited 
active sites and low electrical conductivity of TiO2 usually lead 
to poor catalytic performance. The design of TiO2 with 1) abun-
dant available active sites that prefer to generate NH3 via deep 
NO  reduction  rather  than  following  N−N  coupling  pathways 
to  N2  or  N2O,  2)  morphology  conducive  to  electron  pass/
mass  transport,  and  3)  improved  electrical  conductivity  for 
NO  electrolysis  would  provide  us  high-performance  catalysts 
and meaningful advances in identifying economical and high-
active  NH3-producing  NORR  catalysts,  whereas  related  works 
have been rarely reported.

Herein,  we  report  high-efficiency  NH3  electrosynthesis 
on  oxygen  vacancies  (OVs)  defect-engineered  TiO2−x  using 
low-concentration  NO  as  the  reactant.  An  open  nanoarray 
architecture  of  TiO2−x  further  maximizes  the  utilization  of 
optimized  catalytic  sites  for  NO  adsorption  and  subsequent 
activation.  Accordingly,  such  TiO2−x  nanoarray  on  Ti  plate 
(TiO2−x/TP)  acts  as  a  superb  NH3-producing  3D  nanocata-
lyst  for  NO  electrolysis  in  neutral  media,  attaining  a  great 
yield  of  1233.2  µg  h−1  cm−2  and  high  FE  of  92.5%,  superior 
to many state-of-the-art NORR catalysts (Table S1, Supporting 
Information).  Density  functional  theory  (DFT)  calculations 
identify  *NH2  protonation  to  *NH3  on  TiO2−x  (101)  as  the 
potential-determining  step  with  an  uphill  energy  barrier  of 
only  0.7  eV.  Importantly,  unlike  the  difficult  formation  of 
*NO on perfect TiO2 (101), NO adsorption on the TiO2−x (101) 
results in a dramatic energy drop of ≈2.1 eV, reflecting more 
favorable adsorption properties of defective TiO2−x. Addition-
ally, our TiO2−x/TP is directly applied in a homemade Zn-NO 
battery  as  a  robust  and  kinetically  fast  cathode  to  afford  a 
peak  power  density  of  0.84  mW  cm−1  and  an  NH3  yield  as 
high as 241.7 µg h−1 cm−2.

2. Results and Discussion

2.1. Morphology and Structure Characterizations

The  synthetic  process  of  TiO2−x/TP  is  shown  in  Figure  1a 
including  hydrothermal  treatment,  H+  exchange,  and  H2/Ar  
annealing.  X-ray  diffraction  (XRD)  patterns  for  TiO2−x/TP  
and TiO2−x/TP show typical peaks at 25.4°, 37.9°, 48.1°, 54.0°, and 
55.2°,  which  correspond  to  the  (101),  (004),  (200),  (105),  and 
(211)  facets  of  TiO2  (JCPDS  (Joint  Committee  on  Powder  Dif-
fraction  Standards)  No.  73-1764)  (Figure  1b).[39]  The  diffraction 
peaks at 40.2° and 53.0° attributed to (101) and (102) facets of Ti 
(JCPDS  No.  44-1294).  But,  in  detail,  the  sharp  diffraction  peak 
of  (101)  for  TiO2−x/TP  becomes  weak  compared  with  TiO2/TP. 
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Figure 1c reveals 
the smooth nanoribbons of TiO2−x/TP, which shows no obvious 
difference  with  TiO2/TP  (Figure  S1,  Supporting  Information). 
Energy-dispersive  X-ray  (EDX)  mapping  images  demonstrate 
that elements of Ti and O are uniformly distributed on the sur-
face  of  TiO2−x/TP  (Figure  1d).  Transmission  electron  micros-
copy (TEM) image also reveals the TiO2−x with uniform and no 
obvious defects of morphology, which are consistent with SEM 
results (Figure 1e). The lattice fringe with interplanar distances 
of  0.351  nm  is  observed  from  high-resolution  TEM  (HRTEM) 
shown  in  Figure  1f,  which  can  be  ascribed  to  the  (101)  facet 
of  the  TiO2  phase.  Notably,  the  lattice  fringe  defects  can  be 
detected,  which  suggests  the  successful  formation  of  a  defect-
rich structure.

In order to further verify the existence of OVs, electron para-
magnetic  resonance  (EPR)  test  is  performed.  A  pair  of  shark 
peaks  of  TiO2−x/TP  exhibit  at  g  =  2.002  (Figure  1g),  indicating 
electron  trapping  at  oxygen  defects,  which  is  in  contrast  to  no 
obvious peaks of TiO2/TP.[40] To investigate the surface chemical 
bonding  of  TiO2−x/TP,  X-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  (XPS) 
analysis is implemented. As shown in Ti 2p spectrum, the dis-
tinct peaks of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 appear at 457.9 and 463.8 eV 
belonging to Ti4+ of the TiO2/TP (Figure 1h).[41,42] Nevertheless, 
the  peaks  Ti  2p3/2  and  Ti  2p1/2  of  TiO2−x/TP  shift  to  the  lower 
binding  energy  compared  with  TiO2/TP,  which  attribute  to 
decreased  Ti  oxidation  state.[43]  As  for  O  1s  (Figure  1i),  peaks 
at 529.4, 531.2, and 532.6 eV are related to lattice O, OVs, and 
physisorbed  H2O,  for  TiO2/TP,  respectively.[44–46]  Furthermore, 
the  area  of  OVs  relative  to  the  sum  area  of  all  peaks  [S(OVs)/
(S(physisorbed  H2O)  +  S(OVs)  +  S(lattice  O))]  is  16.7%  for  TiO2−x/TP, 
indicating  that  more  OVs  in  TiO2−x/TP  are  constructed  than 
TiO2/TP  (13.8%).  Above  observations  suggest  the  successful 
construction of OVs in TiO2−x/TP.

2.2. Electrochemical Performance Measurements

A  three-electrode  setup  of  an  H-shape  electrolytic  reactor  con-
taining  0.2  m  phosphate-buffered  solution  (PBS)  with  flowing 
NO  gas  is  used  to  test  the  electrochemical  NORR  perfor-
mance  of  TiO2−x/TP.  The  system  of  three  electrodes  contains 
a  work  electrode  (self-supporting  TiO2−x/TP),  a  reference  elec-
trode  (Ag/AgCl),  and  a  counter  electrode  (graphite  electrode). 
During  the  test,  the  gas  of  NO  (10  vol%)  with  a  flowing  speed
