Electrochemical C–N coupling reactions based on abundant small molecules (such as CO2 and N2) have
attracted increasing attention as a new ‘‘green synthetic strategy’’ for the synthesis of organonitrogen

compounds, which have been widely used in organic synthesis, materials chemistry, and biochemistry.
The traditional technology employed for the synthesis of organonitrogen compounds containing C–N

bonds often requires the addition of metal reagents or oxidants under harsh conditions with high energy

consumption and environmental concerns. By contrast, electrosynthesis avoids the use of other redu-

cing agents or oxidants by utilizing ‘‘electrons’’, which are the cleanest ‘‘reagent’’ and can reduce the

generation of by-products, consistent with the atomic economy and green chemistry. In this study, we

present a comprehensive review on the electrosynthesis of high value-added organonitrogens from the

abundant CO2 and nitrogenous small molecules (N2, NO, NO2
reaction. The associated fundamental concepts, theoretical models, emerging electrocatalysts, and
value-added target products, together with the current challenges and future opportunities are dis-

1. Introduction

The continuous combustion and utilization of natural fuels
have resulted in numerous issues, including CO2 emission-
induced global climate change, environmental destruction, and
potential depletion of non-renewable resources. With the deple-
tion of fossil energy and the increasing environmental issues, it
is urgent to seek and develop clean, cheap, and eﬃcient renew-
able energy sources. In this context, the direct transformation
of earth-abundant small molecules, such as N2, CO2, and H2O,
into high-value-added chemicals, fuels, and fertilizers has
received extensive attention.1–3 However, the industrial synth-
esis of high-value-added chemicals from earth-abundant small
molecules requires harsh conditions with high energy con-
sumption, exacerbating the energy crisis and environmental
problems.4 In this case, electrocatalysis powered by renewable
electricity can lower the energy barrier of the reaction, enabling

the highly efficient synthesis of valuable chemicals under
milder conditions.5–9 Currently, the research on electrosynth-
esis focuses on the efficient resource utilization of abundant
gaseous molecules through electrocatalytic activation and
immobilization.10–13 For example, the electrocatalytic conversion
of CO2 into fuels or value-added chemical products provides a
carbon-neutral cycle, which can mitigate the rapid consumption
of fossil resources and reduce CO2 emissions.14–19

Based on the ‘‘carbon neutrality’’ policy, the capture, trans-
formation, and utilization of CO2 have become a hot topic,
which are also urgent problems to be solved. In particular, the
electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ECRR) powered by
renewable energy sources has attracted considerable interest,
providing possibilities for energy storage and artificial closure
of the carbon cycle under mild conditions.20–25 A large number
of advantages have been envisioned for the wide and deep
research on the electrocatalytic conversion of CO2 into chemi-
cals and fuels via C–O, C–N, and C–C bond formation.26–30

Compared to the pure ECRR technology, the combination of
ECRR with the electrochemical N2 reduction reaction (ENRR)
using earth-abundant and nitrogenous small molecules (N2,
(cid:2), NH3, etc.) as a nitrogen source and renew-
NO, NO2

for the sustainable production of valuable organonitrogen

also avoiding the consumption of a reducing agent (NH3)
