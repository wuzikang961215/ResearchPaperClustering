Abstract—Grid-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs)
are vulnerable to false data injection attacks (FDIAs), which could
be used to disrupt state of charge (SoC) estimation. Inaccurate SoC
estimation has negative impacts on system availability, reliability,
safety, and the cost of operation. In this article a combination of
a Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm and an improved input
noise-aware extended Kalman ﬁlter (INAEKF) is proposed for the
detection and identiﬁcation of FDIAs in the voltage and current
sensors of a battery stack. The series-connected stack is represented
by equivalent circuit models, the SoC is modeled with a charge
reservoir model and the states are estimated using the INAEKF. The
root mean squared error of the states’ estimation by the modiﬁed
INAEKF was found to be superior to the traditional EKF. By

employing the INAEKF, this article addresses the research gap that
many state estimators make asymmetrical assumptions about the
noise corrupting the system. Additionally, the INAEKF estimates
the input allowing for the identiﬁcation of FDIA, which many
alternative methods are unable to achieve. The proposed algorithm
was able to detect attacks in the voltage and current sensors in
99.16% of test cases, with no false positives. Utilizing the INAEKF
compared to the standard EKF allowed for the identiﬁcation of
FDIA in the input of the system in 98.43% of test cases.

I. INTRODUCTION

B ATTERY Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) tied to the

electric power grid are composed of several battery cells,
which are connected to form battery stacks to meet power re-
quirements [2], [3], [4]. BESS are cyberphysical systems (CPSs)
that require several electronic control and protection devices
equipped with computation and communications capabilities for
their safe and efﬁcient operation [5]. One of them, the Battery
management system (BMS) is required to control the charging
and discharging of the cells by monitoring sensor readings, es-
timating system states, and ensuring safe operation of the BESS
[2], [6], [7]. BMSs typically include stack current sensors, volt-
age sensors on each of the battery cells, and an additional voltage
sensor for the battery stack, all of which could be susceptible
to false data injection attacks (FDIAs). FDIAs corrupt sensor
data, which could result in incorrect BMS protection, operation,
and inaccurate state of charge (SoC) estimation [2]. Incorrect
SoC or voltage estimates can cause cell overcharge or deep
discharge, which accelerate battery degradation and can cause
battery thermal runaway, power outages, and damage to costly
power grid equipment [2], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The
goal of attackers could range from practical reduction in usable
SoC to accelerated battery degradation to system malfunctions
or to battery failure, in extreme cases.

To compromise system reliability and damage equipment,
the attacker must carefully construct attack vectors which may
be stealthy or agnostic to the targeted system. Stealthy FDIAs
are constructed to evade bad data detection (BDD) techniques
[14], [15]. As discussed in [15], to elude BDD algorithms
the measurement residuals (following the injection of FDIA)
must remain undisturbed. Therefore, designing stealthy FDIAs
requires extensive information about the system’s topology and

dynamic models to obtain carefully constructed attack vectors.
Liu et al. [14] discussed multiple methods, including brute-force
and heuristic methods, for designing stealthy attack vectors. In
this article, we consider FDIA vectors that are agnostic to the
system’s topology and parameters. These simpler, non-stealthy
attacks are more straightforward and inexpensive to launch and
are more likely to be encountered in real systems.

For the reliable and safe operation of the grid, it is critical that
FDIAs targeting grid-scale BESSs are detected and mitigated as
quickly as possible. Methods for detecting data integrity attacks,
including FDIAs, targeting CPSs have been studied extensively
in literature [2], [14], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23],
[24], [25]. The FDIAs are detected using either model-based
or data-driven methods. Model-based methods typically utilize
statistical approaches to detect anomalies on the residuals ob-
tained by state estimators [1], [18], [20], [26]. On the other hand,
Data-driven methods [23], [24], [25] do not require a model
of the physical system and focus on learning system dynamics
by processing sensor data streams. Common statistical methods
used to detect FDIAs and other anomalies are the chi-squared test
[18] and variations of the cumulative sum (CUSUM) algorithm
[1], [19], [20], [26]. The chi-squared test is a popular choice
to discover abnormalities in CPSs [18], [27] but is known to
have higher false positive rates. The chi-squared test was used
to detect outliers in the measurements of a battery during SoC
estimation and was found to trigger multiple false positives [27].
Bombarding the BMS with warnings about anomalies when
nothing is truly wrong could hinder system operation, therefore
it is critical to minimize false positives while maximizing true
positives. One beneﬁt of the CUSUM algorithm used in this
article is that the false positive rate can be adjusted to zero by
appropriately selecting the parameters of the algorithm, most
commonly the value of the upper and lower thresholds.

A signiﬁcant limitation of residual-based FDIA detectors is
their inability to detect errors in the input variables [1], [2].
Most state estimation methods, including variants of the Kalman
Filter (KF) [28], assume that inputs are accurately known and
deterministic. Therefore, residual-based error detection cannot
be applied to the input since their residuals cannot be calculated.
The dynamic models used in SoC estimation utilize the stack
current as the system input [3], which is obtained from current
sensors. Considering the architecture of BMSs [5], [29], it is
clear that, similar to voltage measurements, current sensors
are also subject to disturbances from noise, faults, or attacks.
Nevertheless, a gap exists in the battery SoC estimation literature
as uncertainty in the input variable is not accounted for. Variants
of the KF that consider noisy inputs, such as [23], [24], have
not been applied to battery SoC estimation nor FDIA detection.
State estimators based on the unknown input observer or ro-
bust state estimation (e.g., [21], [22], [30]) could potentially
mitigate errors introduced by FDIA in the input variable or
even detect input attacks in SoC estimation. However, those
require the solution of relatively large optimization problems
involving time-series of sensor data, making them ill-suited for
implementation in real-time embedded systems with limited
memory and computational capacity like BMSs.

Data-driven anomaly identiﬁcation methods are used more
frequently in literature but have their own set of limitations.
Authors in [24] and [25] use deep learning methods, speciﬁcally
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to detect errors in battery
systems’ operation which may include faults or cyberattacks. In
the survey article [23], Sayghe et al. discuss supervised, semi-
supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning methods to detect
FDIAs in power systems. To train data-driven methods, hundreds
of datasets may be required. For example, to train the CNN
presented in [24], 100 control datasets and 300 fault datasets
were used. Battery data used to train data-based methods is often
proprietary data that may be challenging or expensive to obtain,
giving residual-based battery modeling methods an advantage
over data driven methods. In addition, battery models can be
adjusted to account for changing battery parameters by updating
the model parameters [8], [31], whereas data driven methods rely
highly on the training data and algorithm setup to yield accurate
detection [23].

A. Overview of the Method and Paper Organization

This article extends the work [1] and addresses many of the
aforementioned limitations of the state-of-the-art by developing
an input noise-aware extended KF (INAEKF) to perform SoC
estimation. The INAEKF is better suited for the SoC estimation
framework than the extended KF (EKF), as it is well known that
battery stack current measurements are susceptible to noise and
may be subject to spooﬁng attacks [32]. The proposed method
extends the EKF utilized in [1] by considering additive Gaussian
noise in the input of the state estimator. Accounting for additive
noise in the input variable has been previously proposed for
the KF [33] and the unscented KF (UKF) [34], but none of
those methods have been applied to SoC estimation and we were
unable to ﬁnd literature that provided the framework for an EKF
that considered input noise, which is accomplished in this article.
These methods allow for estimation of the input variable and,
consequently, an input residual, which allows for postprocessing
of the input signal for faults, bad data, and attack detection.
Additionally, the INAEKF can mitigate the error introduced by
noisy input data, thus providing more accurate state estimates
than the traditional EKF when the input variable is subject
to zero-mean random noise. That is especially relevant given
that SoC estimation of batteries is known to be susceptible to
measurement errors [35].

To conform to the new state estimation framework, the battery
model proposed in this article presents improvements upon the
model utilized in [1]. These enhancements include removing the
stack current from the vector of measurements and modeling it
in the state estimator as a single noisy input variable, i.e., its
signal is not split into two variables representing the charging
and discharging currents. Instead, a nonlinear function is used to
account for the stack current-dependent Coulombic efﬁciency.
The case studies demonstrate the superior performance of the
INAEKF when compared with the EKF in terms of estimation
accuracy and FDIA detection. We also compare the CUSUM
with the chi-squared test for attack detection.
