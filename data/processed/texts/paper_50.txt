Iodide redox reactions in molten NaI/AlCl3 are shown to generate surface-blocking ﬁlms, which may limit the useful cycling rates
and energy densities of molten sodium batteries below 150 °C. An experimental investigation of electrode interfacial stability at
110 °C reveals the source of the reaction rate limitations. Electrochemical experiments in a 3-electrode conﬁguration conﬁrm an
increase of resistance on the electrode surface after oxidation or reduction current is passed. Using chronopotentiometry,
chronoamperometry, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, the ﬁlm formation is shown to depend on
− in the molten salt
the electrode material (W, Mo, Ta, or glassy carbon), as well as the Lewis acidity and molar ratio of I−/I3
electrolytes. These factors impact the amount of charge that can be passed at a given current density prior to developing excessive
overpotential due to ﬁlm formation that blocks the electrode surface. The results presented here guide the design and use of iodide-
based molten salt electrolytes and electrode materials for grid scale battery applications.

Molten sodium batteries (MNaBs) with metal halide-sodium
iodide electrolytes have emerged as an Earth-abundant,1 cost-
effective, and safe technology for grid scale electrochemical energy
storage.2,3 This class of low-temperature (<150 °C) MNaBs is
enabled by a Na-ion superconductor
(NaSICON, nominally
Na1+xZr2SixP3-xO12) solid electrolyte,4–6 which physically separates
the Na metal anode from the molten salt electrolyte.7,8 Mixtures of
NaI and AlCl3 offer relatively inexpensive, nonﬂammable, highly
conductive (>100 mS cm−1), highly concentrated (>4 mol l−1),
redox-active electrolytes at temperatures slightly above the melting
point of Na metal (98 °C). Despite these advantages, achieving the
high cycling rates needed for on-demand, high-rate energy storage
applications may present challenges for this molten salt chemistry at
low temperatures (<150 °C).

Pairing the iodide redox couple with alkali metal anodes in
nonaqueous electrolytes for a battery cell >3 V was investigated by
Hanson and Tobias in 1987.9 More recently, iodide electrochemistry
has seen applications in Zn/I2 redox ﬂow batteries,10–13 room
temperature ionic liquid electrolytes,14 and dye-sensitized solar
cells.15,16 Much of the research on iodide electrochemistry has
been devoted to discerning the reaction mechanisms,17–19 character-

dependent on the solvent22,27,28 and concentration.20 For low-
temperature MNaBs with NaI/AlCl3 electrolytes in particular, the
species and phases present depend on the electrolyte composition,
which varies with the battery’s state of charge (SoC) via the ratio of

provide a better mechanistic picture of whether the redox reaction rates
are limited by mass transport, charge transfer kinetics, or electrode
surface changes, such as adsorption or blocking. This understanding
will aid in identifying what engineering solutions can be used to
improve the battery’s energy efﬁciency and power density. Toward
this goal, we investigate the NaI/AlCl3 system using cyclic voltam-
metry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), chron-
oamperometry (CA), and chronopotentiometry (CP). The 3-electrode
conﬁguration employed here isolates the electrode in contact with the
molten salt electrolyte.29 Although the selection of materials chemi-
cally compatible with the NaI/AlCl3 electrolyte is limited, we examine
three refractory metals:
tungsten (W), molybdenum (Mo), and
tantalum (Ta), as well as glassy carbon (GC) as candidate electrode
materials. Ideally, these materials need to be not only chemically inert
in the electrolyte, but cost-effective and electrocatalytically active. The
electrochemical behavior of the candidate electrodes is examined at
two SoCs (7.5 and 50%) and two molar ratios of the NaI/AlCl3
electrolyte (nominally, Lewis acidic and Lewis basic). Results show
that electrode materials and electrolyte compositions differ most
notably in their susceptibility to blockage caused by reversible surface
ﬁlm formation during electrolysis. Electrolyte composition—through
both Lewis acidity and SoC—impacts the phase stability of electro-
chemical reaction products and their tendency to form electrode-
blocking ﬁlms. These insights will guide the future development of
low-temperature MNaBs for sustainable grid scale energy storage.

Experimental

Electrolyte composition.—Electrolytes were made by mixing
NaI (ultra-dry, 99.99%, Alfa Aesar), AlCl3 (ultra-dry, 99.99%, Alfa
Aesar), and I2 (ultra-dry, 99.998%, Alfa Aesar), all of which were
used without further puriﬁcation and were handled in an Ar-ﬁlled
glovebox with <0.1 ppm H2O and O2. Electrolyte compositions are
listed in Table I. The theoretical capacity of the electrolyte is
