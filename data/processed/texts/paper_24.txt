Although photocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (PNRR) is a green ammonia synthesis technology, it still 
encounters  low  adsorption/activation  efficiency  of  N2  and  lack  of  reaction  active  sites.  Element  doping  is  an 
efficient strategy to regulate electronic structure of catalyst. Nevertheless, the mechanism of the effect of doping 
elements on the N2 adsorption/activation, reaction active site and energy barriers is not well unraveled. Taking 
Co  doped  Bi2MoO6  (Co-Bi2MoO6)  as  a  model  photocatalyst,  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  and  experiment 
study were used to investigate the mechanism of Co doping on the PNRR performance over Bi2MoO6. DFT results 
reveal that Co doping regulates the electronic structure, activates Bi sites of Co-Bi2MoO6  and provides new Co 
active  sites,  thus  constructing  dual  active  sites  for  PNRR.  Benefited  from  dual  active  sites  for  effectively 
adsorption/activation N2, the as-fabricated 3% Co-Bi2MoO6  exhibit the maximum NH3  generation rate of 95.5 
(cid:0) 1 without sacrificial agents, which is 7.2 times that of Bi2MoO6. Furthermore, the detail mechanism 
μmol⋅g
of N–––N bond adsorption/activation and hydrogenation reaction on Co-Bi2MoO6 was also proposed according to 
in-situ FTIR and DFT results. This study provides a promising strategy to design catalysts with dual active sites for 
PNRR, which is of great significance to the popularization of other material systems.

1. Introduction 

Ammonia (NH3) is a decisive component of the commercial synthesis 
of fertilizers, refrigerants and military applications [1]. Besides, NH3 is 
an ideal hydrogen storage material, as it can easily condense into liquid 
for storage. Accordingly, it is assumed that NH3 may play an important 
role in hydrogen economy and can be used as the power of fuel cells to 
provide a good strategy to deal with the energy crisis [2–4]. Currently, 
industrial ammonia is produced through Haber-Bosch process, which is 
conditioned  by  high-purity  nitrogen  (N2)  and  hydrogen  (H2)  streams 
under high pressure (15–25 MPa) and high temperature (400–500 
C), 
consuming a large amount of energy and capital [5]. These shortcom-
ings  have  widely  aroused  interest  in  developing  sustainable  and 
environment-friendly  strategies  of  ammonia  synthesis  to  reach  the 
ambitious carbon peak and carbon neutrality objectives [6,7].

Photocatalytic  nitrogen reduction reaction  (PNRR) is  an attractive 
way to substitute for Haber-Bosch’s production of NH3 as it utilizes the 
inexhaustible solar and water to directly provide electrons and protons 

for N2 hydrogenation to NH3, instead of supply high purity hydrogen [8, 
9]. The development of high-efficient PNRR catalysts has caused a range 
of research activities [10,11]. Unfortunately, most of currently devel-
oped photocatalytic materials still suffer from low adsorption/activation 
efficiency  of  N2  and  lack  of  reaction  active  sites,  exhibiting  limited 
conversion  efficiencies  for PNRR  [12].  So  far,  numerous  studies  have 
been conducted to regulate the electronic structure of photocatalyst so 
as to optimize its nitrogen fixation performance [13]. Transitional metal 
element doping is widely used as an effective strategy to regulate the 
electronic structure to strengthen the N2 adsorption/activation [14–17]. 
Xiong’s group reported that Mo doping can efficiently enhance the N2 
adsorption/activation on the surface of W18O49 ultrathin nanowires, in 
which the coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms with oxygen defects 
serve as the sites for N2  adsorption/activation [14]. Recently, Yin and 
co-works created new active sites on MoS2 for the adsorption of N2 and 
dissociation of nonpolar N–––
N bond by Mn doping, in which the expo-
sure of Mo edge sites is higher due to the formation of S vacancies [16].

and creation of defective-type active sites of photocatalyst has been well 
researched, the effect of doped element on inherent active sites, as well 
as act as new active sites on N2  adsorption/activation and energy bar-
riers over photocatalyst is not well unraveled. 

In  this  work,  taking  Co  doped  Bi2MoO6  (Co-Bi2MoO6)  as  a  model 
photocatalyst, density functional theory (DFT) was used to investigate 
the effect of Co-doping on partial density of states (DOS), differential 
charge density and energy barrier of Bi2MoO6. DFT results reveal that Co 
doping not only regulates the electronic structure, but also activates Bi 
sites of Co-Bi2MoO6 and provides new Co active sites, thus constructing 
dual  active  sites  for  PNRR.  Under  the  guidance  of  DFT  results,  Co- 
Bi2MoO6 was synthesized by a facile solvothermal process. Ascribed to 
Co-doping  regulated  the  electronic  structure  of  Bi2MoO6  to  construct 
dual  active  sites  for  effectively  adsorption/activation  N2,  the  as- 
fabricated  3%  Co-Bi2MoO6  achieved  the  maximum  NH3  generation 
(cid:0) 1  under visible light irradiation without sacri-
rate of 95.5 μmol⋅g
ficial agents, which is 7.2 times that of Bi2MoO6. Furthermore, the detail 
steps for N–––
N bond adsorption/activation and hydrogenation reaction 
pathway on Co-Bi2MoO6 are depicted according to DFT and in-situ FTIR 
results. This study provides fresh insights into design catalysts with dual 
active sites for PNRR and reaffirms the versatility of subtle electronic 
structure modulation in tuning catalytic activity.

2. Experimental and computational section 

2.1. Preparation of Bi2MoO6 

Pure  Bi2MoO6  was  prepared  by  solvothermal  method.  Typically, 
under intense stirring, 1.94 g of Bi(NO3)3•5 H2O (4 mmol) and 0.484 g 
of  Na2MoO4•2  H2O  (2  mmol)  were  dissolved  in  a  mixed  solution  of 
glycol  (40  mL)  and  ethanol (10  mL)  to  obtain  transparent  liquid  and 
transfer  to  a  65  mL  autoclave  lined  with  polytetrafluoroethylene  for 
solvothermal reaction at 190 
C for 2 h. The yellow precipitation was 
then  separated, washed  with  ethanol  and  deionized  water  for several 
times, and dried to obtain Bi2MoO6 product.

2.2. Preparation of Co-Bi2MoO6 

◦

The  Co-Bi2MoO6  photocatalyst  was  prepared  by  hydrothermal 
(cid:0) 1  CoCl2⋅6  H2O 
method.  In  a  typical  process,  40  mL  of  0.0005  mol•L
solution was taken into a 100 mL beaker, and 1 g of Bi2MoO6 was added 
to the solution, and stirred for 1 h. Finally, the homogeneous solution 
was transferred into a 65 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and 
maintained at 160 
C for 5 h. The product was separated by centrifu-
gation, washed with ethanol and deionized water for several times and 
then  dried  overnight.  The  obtained  product  was  marked  as  0.5%  Co- 
Bi2MoO6. The change in CoCl2⋅6 H2O (0.001, 0.002, 0.003, 0.004, 0.006 
(cid:0) 1)  concentration  was  used  to  create  a  series  of  samples  for 
mol•L
experimental optimization, which were referred to as X% Co-Bi2MoO6 
(X  = 0.5,  1,  2,  3,  4,  6,  X  means  the  mass  ratio  of  CoCl2⋅6  H2O  and 
Bi2MoO6). 

2.3. Photocatalysis nitrogen reduction reaction 

The photocatalytic activity of nitrogen fixation was evaluated under 
visible light. Generally, in a quartz reaction, add photocatalyst (100 mg) 
to ultrapure water (150 mL). Before irradiation, to eliminate dissolved 
oxygen, the suspension was rapidly agitated in the dark for 30 min and 
bubbled in high purity nitrogen. During irradiation, 7 mL of solution was 
taken out every 30 min, and then centrifuged at 11000 rpm for 5 min to 
+
remove  photocatalyst  for  the  following  NH3/NH4
concentration 
analysis. 

2.4. Theoretical calculations 

The DOS, differential charge density and energy barrier of Bi2MoO6 

and  Co-Bi2MoO6  were  performed  through  the  spin-polarized  density 
functional theory (DFT) as implemented by the Vienna ab initio simu-
lation  package  (VASP).  Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof  (PBE)  generalized 
gradient  approximation  (GGA)  was  used  to  describe  the  exchange- 
correlation energy functional. Projected augmented wave (PAW) pseu-
dopotential  was  used  for  depicting  the  ion  core  and  the  periodic 
boundary  condition.  Spin  polarization  was  also  considered.  A  2  × 1 
supercell, three layers of pristine Bi2MoO6 (010) and Co-Bi2MoO6 (010) 
surface  were  chosen  to  construct  the  investigated  models.  Geometry 
optimizations,  DOS,  differential  charge  density  and  free  energy  were 
(cid:0) 5 eV in energy and 0.05 
performed with a convergence threshold of 10
eV/Å for the force. A vacuum of 15 Å along the z-direction was used, 
which was large enough to minimize the interactions between periodic 
images. The free energy of PNRR was calculated by using the equation:  

ΔG=Esurface+adsorbate-Esurface-Eadsorbate+ΔEZPE-TΔS,                                    

where G, E, ZPE and TS represent the free energy, total energy from DFT 
calculations, zero point energy and entropic contributions, respectively. 

3. Results and discussion 

3.1. DFT calculation for catalysts design 

The key step in the PNRR process is known to be adsorption/acti-
vation  of  N2  on  catalyst surface.  During the  N2  adsorption/activation 
process,  the  electrons  on  bonding  orbital  (highest  occupied  molecule 
orbital, HOMO, 2δg) of N2 interact with the d-orbital of catalyst active 
site to form the adsorption state. Then the d-orbital electrons of catalyst 
active site feedback to anti-bonding orbital (lowest unoccupied mole-
cule orbital, LUMO, 1πg) of the N2 to activate the N–––
N bond to form N2 
+
active state (⋅N2), and then⋅N2 reacts with the H
and photo-generated 
electrons  to  form  NH3  (Fig.  1a).  Hence,  it  is  crucial  that  catalytic 
active  site  provide  symmetric  orbit  matching  with  the  anti-bonding 
orbital of the N2. 

Bismuth  molybdate  (Bi2MoO6)  is  a  typical  Aurivillius  oxide, 
composed  of  a  layered  structure  with  alternate  stacking  of  (Bi2O2)2+
sheets interleaved with [MoO4]2- layer [18]. The hybridization of Bi 6 s 
and O 2p orbit constitute its valence band (VB), Mo 4d (4d5) constitute 
its conduction band (CB) (Fig. 1b and c) [19,20]. Thermodynamic, the 
energy band structure of Bi2MoO6  meets the potential requirement of 
the PNRR [21]. Theoretically, the structure of Bi2MoO6 determines that 
Bi sites (Bi2MoO6-Bi) is responsible for N2 molecule adsorption/activa-
tion other than Mo sites in the PNRR. Nevertheless, the Bi 6 s orbit is 
difficult to form adsorption states with the N2 molecules. The Co atoms 
possesses ideal d-band electronic structure (3d7) that spatially matches 
the anti-bonding orbital of N2 [22]. As shown in Fig. 1d, the high overlap 
of  N,  Bi,  and  Co  peaks  in  the  PDOS indicates  that the  Co-Bi2MoO6  is 
propitious to accept electrons from N2  HOMO (2δg) to form adsorbed 
state  N2,  and  then  electrons  transfer  from  the  Co  d-orbital  to  the 
anti-bonding orbital (LUMO, 1πg) of N–––
N to activate N2. Furthermore, 
Co  doping  induces an impurity  energy level near  the top of  Bi2MoO6 
valence band, which is beneficial for electron excitation [23]. According 
to the differential charge density (Fig. 1e), it is clear that the electrons 
transfer  from  d-orbital  Co  sites  (Co-Bi2MoO6-Co)  to  the  anti-bonding 
orbital  of  adsorbed  N2.  Therefore,  the  essence  of  the  N2  adsorptio-
n/activation on the surface  of transition metal site (Co and Bi) is the 
“acceptance  donation”  of  electrons,  where  the  electron  structure  of 
d orbitals determines the energy barriers of PNRR. 

The DFT calculations were further performed to gain insight into the 
effect  of  Co  doping  on  N2  adsorption/activation  as  well  as  reveal 
inherent  mechanism  of  PNRR  activity  [24–26].  Fig.  2a  exhibited  the 
d-orbital DOS of Co-Bi2MoO6 and Bi2MoO6 to examine the influence of 
Co doping on the electronic structure. The d-band centers of Co-Bi2MoO6 
and Bi2MoO6  are (cid:0) 3.1 and (cid:0) 2.7 eV, respectively. Co-doping resulted 
in  shifting  up  d-band  center  of  Bi2MoO6,  which  may  be  in  favor  of
