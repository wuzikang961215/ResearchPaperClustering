Governments  worldwide  have  prioritized  carbon  reduction  and  neutrality  to  address  the  escalating  threat  of 
climate change. These goals are in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG-13). 
These goals stress taking action on climate change to lessen the bad effects of human activities and using fossil 
fuels for energy. To this end, the present study investigates the connection between conventional energy usage, 
agricultural  practices,  economic  growth,  and  their  impact  on  environmental  sustainability  in  South  Africa. 
Additionally, it explores the role of renewable energy consumption and environmental technological innovation 
in mitigating these effects. To achieve the study objectives, a carbon-income function is fitted with an annual 
frequency  data  from  1975  to  2020.  The  present  study  leverages  on  Pesaran's  Autoregressive  distributed  lag 
(ARDL) method and for robustness analysis the dynamic ARDL simulations method to simultaneously explore the 
short and long-run coefficients of the study's outlined variables. Empirical analysis, confirmed by bounds testing 
for  cointegration, reveals  a long-term  equilibrium relationship among  the  variables considered.  Notably, eco-
nomic growth, fossil fuel energy consumption, and agricultural activities have adverse effects on environmental 
sustainability in South Africa, indicating a trade-off between economic growth and environmental quality. Dy-
namic  ARDL  simulations  provide  further  evidence  of  an  Environmental  Kuznets  Curve  (EKC)  phenomenon. 
However,  renewable  energy  consumption  and  environmental  technological  innovation  positively  influence 
environmental quality. These findings highlight the imperative for South Africa and its stakeholders to adopt 
green growth policies and transition to cleaner energy alternatives.   

1. Introduction 

The  world  faces  an  unprecedented  challenge  escalating  climate 
change  resulting  from  a  surge  in  carbon  dioxide  (CO2) emissions  pri-
marily  attributed  to  human  activities  [9,43].  Boden  et  al.  [13]  and 
Adebayo  et  al.  [1]  reveal  that  global  CO2  emissions  have  surged  by 
nearly 90% since 1970, with fossil fuel combustion and industrial ac-
tivities  responsible  for  about  78%  of  this  increase.  Moreover, 

agriculture, deforestation, and land-use alterations represent significant 
contributors  to  greenhouse  gas  emissions  [10].  The  adverse  conse-
quences  of  rising  CO2  levels  are  profound  and  include  air  pollution, 
responsible  for  seven  million  premature  deaths  a  year,  and  environ-
mental disasters like flooding and forest fires [27,81]. 

Despite contributing only 3% of global CO2  emissions, African na-
tions,  led  by  South  Africa,  bear  the  brunt  of  climate  change,  with 
devastating  impacts  like  floods  [77].  Flooding,  resulting  from  CO2

accumulation,  has  severely  impacted  the  economies  of  Mozambique, 
Madagascar, and South Africa [69]. Additionally, South Africa's expo-
sure to climate change is starkly evident; in 2019, 750,000 people were 
affected  by  drought,  and  4500  were  displaced  due  to  floods  [82]. 
Although the share of GDP lost to flooding in South Africa is minimal, 
the monetary value of climate disasters amounts to an estimated $4.5 
billion [82]. Therefore, the pursuit of carbon neutrality—a reduction in 
technological 
renewable 
CO2 
innovations—is vital for South Africa. 

emissions  using 

energy  and 

South Africa's heavy reliance on fossil fuels, especially coal, further 
exacerbates the carbon emissions problem [36,50]. In 2022, fossil fuels 
accounted for approximately 94.24% of the country's energy consump-
tion,  with  coal  alone  constituting  84.4%  [69].  This  reliance  on  coal 
makes  South  Africa  a  major  contributor  to  Africa's  CO2  emissions 
[45,48].  Unbridled  use  of  fossil  fuels,  such  as  oil,  coal,  and  gas,  in-
tensifies CO2 emissions [47,48,77]. 

Additionally,  the  agricultural  sector  has  been  scrutinized  as  a  sig-
nificant  source  of  CO2  emissions  [16,67].  Agricultural  activities  like 
deforestation,  mechanization,  and 
the  destruction  of  carbon- 
sequestering  trees  contribute  to  emissions  [71,73].  Notably,  South 
Africa's agricultural sector, comprising both commercial and small-scale 
agriculture, contributes approximately 10% of the nation's greenhouse 
gas emissions (GHGs) [5]. High agricultural productivity in South Africa 
necessitates energy-intensive processes powered by fossil fuels, further 
increasing CO2 emissions [74]. 

The relationship between economic growth and CO2  emissions is a 
subject of debate, with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory 
suggesting  that  as  GDP  grows,  CO2  emissions  initially  rise  before 
declining with technological adoption [27,76]. South Africa's growing 
economy, with the third-largest GDP in Africa, stands to expand further, 
driven  by  industrialization  and  urbanisation  [69].  This  economic 
growth,  while  promising  prosperity,  also  threatens  environmental 
quality due to potential CO2 increases. 

Despite  being  Africa's  leading  CO2  emitter,  South  Africa  has 
committed  to  reducing  carbon  emissions  and  achieving  carbon 
neutrality by 2050 to combat climate change . To attain this goal, South 
Africa must transition to renewable energy sources and embrace eco- 
friendly  innovations,  effectively  reducing  CO2  emissions  [21].  The 
country boasts significant renewable energy potential, including solar 
and  hydropower  opportunities  [7,8].  Embracing  environmentally 
friendly  technologies  like  carbon  capture  and  energy-efficient  appli-
ances will further support carbon reduction [23]. 

Aligned  with  the  United  Nations'  Sustainable  Development  Goals 
(SDGs), South Africa's commitment to sustainability necessitates a sub-
stantial reduction in CO2 emissions [30,31,66]. Achieving the SDGs and 
South Africa's National Development Plan requires a significant reduc-
tion in CO2 emissions [61]. 

This research investigates the combined impact of agriculture, fossil 
fuels, and economic growth on carbon neutrality in South Africa. It also 
explores  how  renewable  energy  consumption  and  environmental  and 
technological  innovations  contribute  to  carbon  reduction.  Our  study 
makes  a  holistic  assessment  of  the  drivers  of  CO2  emissions  in  South 
Africa, an essential endeavour as the highest emitter in Africa. More-
over, it evaluates the role of renewable energy and ecological technol-
ogies  in  emissions  reduction.  Finally,  this  study  utilizes  the  Pesaran's 
autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) methodology combined with dy-
namic ARDL simulations to provide short-term and long-term strategies 
for carbon neutrality. 

Therefore, the organisation of this paper follows thus; following the 
introduction, part 2 is the literature review, part 3 is the methodology, 
part  4  presents  empirical  analysis,  and  part  5  presents  the  research 
conclusion and implications. 

2. Literature review 

2.1. Theoretical review 

The theory that is relevant to our study is the Environmental Kuznet 
Curve (EKC) theory based on the argument of Grossman and Krueger 
[25]. According to the EKC theory, the quality of the environment and 
real production have a non-linear connection that is defined by an up-
ward curve and a falling curve. Dogan and Turkekul [19] noted that, up 
until a particular GDP level, environmental degradation occasioned by 
productivity first rises as economic activity (as measured by GDP) rises. 
Beyond this point, continued economic expansion is linked to a reduc-
tion in environmental damage [72]. The argument of the EKC indicates 
that environmental disasters occasioned by CO2 have a quadratic func-
tion with economic growth, which represents economic productive ac-
tivities that need energy use [9]. 

The EKC provides a theoretical understanding of the race towards 
carbon  neutrality  by  adopting  renewable  energy  use,  environmental 
technology,  and  innovation through  economic  growth,  fossil  fuel  and 
agricultural productivity channels. Based on the assumption of the EKC, 
the initial rise in environmental pollution due to excessive discharge of 
CO2 because of output productivity can be driven by fossil fuel energy, 
agricultural  productivity  and  overall  GDP  growth.  According  to 
Mthembu [48] and Mesagan et al. [43], fossil fuel consumption releases 
carbon  discharge  into  the  atmosphere,  negatively  affecting  environ-
mental  quality.  Jahanger  et  al.  [31]  also  emphasised  that  carbon  is 
present in substantial amounts in fossil fuels. For instance, carbon is the 
main  component  of  coal.  When  these  substances  are  burned,  carbon 
atoms join with oxygen to create CO2, which releases energy. Therefore, 
since South Africa is a coal-dependent nation, the EKC provides insight 
as to why it is the largest emitter of CO2  in Africa [48]. Furthermore, 
agricultural productivity has been identified in the literature as a key 
contributor to CO2 emission [16,67]. South Africa's agricultural sector 
has evolved rapidly in recent years into a dual sector which is largely 
mechanised. Tagwi [71] emphasised that mechanised farming requires 
energy  intensity,  and  South  Africa  has  utilised  fossil  fuels  to  power 
machines to increase productivity. Therefore, as farm operations rise, 
emission from the process increases CO2 accumulation. Also, the overall 
GDP growth will worsen pollution for South Africa since it is still in a 
state of  convergence  with  the developed  economies,  as  argued in  the 
EKC that, at the initial stage of growth, CO2 pollution rises [18]. 

The EKC argued that environmental pollution reverses as economic 
productivity increases in the long run. Jahanger et al. [31] noted that, at 
this  stage,  the  incorporation  of  renewable  energy  and  environmental 
technology and innovation in the production processes aids the decline 
in pollution since they support energy and carbon efficiency. Moreover, 
Ibekilo and Emmanuel [28] posited that technological innovation can 
reverse  unpleasant  environmental  circumstances  that  emanate  from 
production processes. Also, evidence from Feng [23] and Wen et al. [79] 
supports the role of renewable energy use in lowering carbon releases. 
Therefore,  incorporating  renewable  energy  and  environmental  tech-
nology and innovation following the EKC argument can aid the analysis 
of the significance of renewable energy use. Environmental technology 
and innovation is driving carbon neutrality via fossil fuel energy, agri-
cultural productivity and GDP growth in South Africa. 

2.2. Empirical review 

This section of the literature review explores related study areas. The 
review is organised in two strands. The first strand reviews evidence that 
has considered the effect of fossil fuel, agricultural output and economic 
growth on CO2 release, while the second strand explores evidence on the 
role of renewable energy consumption and environmental technology
