ABSTRACT: Zinc alkaline anodes command signiﬁcant share
of consumer battery markets and are a key technology for the
emerging grid-scale battery market. Improved understanding of
this electrode is required for long-cycle deployments at kWh
and MWh scale due to strict requirements on performance,
cost, and safety. Here we give a modern literature survey of zinc
alkaline anodes with levelized performance metrics and also
present an experimental assessment of leading formulations.
Long-cycle materials characterization, performance metrics, and
failure analysis are reported for over 25 unique anode
formulations with up to 1500 cycles and ∼1.5 years of shelf
life per test. Statistical repeatability of these measurements is
made for a baseline design (fewest additives) via 15 duplicates.
Baseline design capacity density is 38 mAh per mL of anode
volume, and lifetime throughput is 72 Ah per mL of anode volume. We then report identical measurements for anodes with
improved material properties via additives and other perturbations, some of which achieve capacity density over 192 mAh per mL
of anode volume and lifetime throughput of 190 Ah per mL of anode volume. Novel in operando X-ray microscopy of a cycling
zinc paste anode reveals the formation of a nanoscale zinc material that cycles electrochemically and replaces the original anode
structure over long-cycle life. Ex situ elemental mapping and other materials characterization suggest that the key physical
processes are hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), growth of zinc oxide nanoscale material, concentration deﬁcits of OH− and
ZnOH4

2−, and electrodeposition of Zn growths outside and through separator membranes.

■ INTRODUCTION

Energy storage technology is expanding due to new
applications with grid services, private homes, and microgrids.
Nationally, GWh deployment of energy storage is necessary for
the coming decade to stabilize the grid-penetration of wind and
solar power.1,2 Market analysis suggests that economically
viable price points for energy storage range from $30−$500 per
kWh depending on the speciﬁc application.3 Fire safety is often
in dense
a deal breaker, particularly in household locations,
urban environments, or near grid substation equipment.
Lithium-ion technology remains a ﬁre hazard,4−6 which
prohibits its use in some locations. It also has a price unlikely
to fall below $200 per kWh,7 which limits its return-on-
investment for many applications. Lead acid has poor cycle-life
and a slow charge/discharge rate, making it a costly option.
Alternative technologies are therefore in development,
for example, Zn
including much recent work with Zn,
intercalation cathodes,8 novel Ni cathodes for NiZn cells,9
shallow-cycle Mn cathodes for MnZn cells,10 high capacity Mn
cathodes for MnZn cells,11,12 and ﬂow-assisted Zn technolo-
gies.13,14 Several zinc-based battery startup companies are

currently underway, and many recent high-proﬁle publications
utilize Zn anodes.8,9,11,12,14,15

Reviews of zinc alkaline electrodes by McLarnon and
Cairns16 and Bass et al.17 form a database for design variations
as known in the late 1980s, but they give scant performance
appraisal. More recent reviews18−20 leave out most of the
literature and do not compare performance with a rigorous
levelized metric. Commercial and academic interest now
warrants a new and thorough literature survey and a levelized
performance comparison of all known designs. Therefore, we
here assess known technologies by levelized and industrially
relevant metrics and report a long-cycle testing program to
validate the technologies and discover new ones. The metrics
focus on cycle life and capacity density.

Table 1 presents the literature review and performance
comparison. It includes only studies that reported cycle testing
and mostly excludes technologies that use Hg or Cd due to the
impracticality of using these additives under modern

aCycle life was deﬁned as the number of cycles until capacity drops below 75% of the average capacity or until Coulombic eﬃciency drops below
75%. Many publications that reported low capacity (<20 mAh/mL) was not included. bCycle-average discharge capacity divided by grams of paste
including binders, additives, and electrolyteignoring current collector. cCycle-average mAh discharge capacity, divided by total volume necessary
(including excess electrolyte) for the anode to operate. dMultiplication of the mAh/mL and cycle life columns gives lifetime Coulombic output per
volume required for the anode. eThese publications did not disclose suﬃcient information to calculate any rigorous performance metric. fThey did
not measure cycle life. They saw Pb and Tl to improve gassing rate and shape change in cells purposefully dissected after 32 cycles. gApproximately
half of their calcium zincate exists as Ca(OH)2 and ZnO. They get Coulombic eﬃciency near 75% for their initial cycles, and it drops to 72% by cycle
500; therefore, we list this technology as capable of 400 cycles. hZhang et al.’s cell contained unrealistic excess of electrolyte, which warped their
results. See Figure S25 of Supporting Information. iThe cyclic voltammograms and chronopotentiometry charge curves suggest ref 10’s active
material was not calcium zincate. Instead, their evidence suggests zincate from their electrolyte was plating and deplating from the electrode surface
as zinc metal. jInsuﬃcient information exists in refs 49−51 to calculate mAh/mL, mAh/g, or mAh/cm2 because porosity of the hyper-dendritic foam
was not given, nor was the electrode size, charge density (mAh cycled per cm2 of electrode area), or electrolyte volume. kLikely operated in excess
electrolyte (>100 mL per mAh cycled) such that Zn0 electrodeposition could be the dominant active material. lDid not clearly report anode
thickness, porosity, or excess electrolyte. Porosity was estimated using available information in the paper. mOnly 1 mAh cm−2 was tested, which is
∼15-times lower than a realistic battery. Backside plating from zincate solution requires extra volume for adequate mass transfer and for the low
solubility of zincate in 6 M KOH. The practicality of backside plating is dubious.

governmental regulations. The key performance metrics are (i)
discharge capacity density (mAh per mL), (ii) discharge speciﬁc
capacity density (mAh per gram), and (iii) lifetime total
discharge capacity (Ah per mL), where mL and gram include all
components of the anode, excluding the current collector, but
including electrolyte used to operate the anode in each
technology disclosure, for example, excess electrolyte enables
room for dendritic structures or backside plating, and allows
2− to form instead of zinc oxides. Cost per mAh and

shelf life should be additional metrics but are not listed here
because such data are so scarce in the literature.

A graphical representation of the data from Table 1 is shown
in Figure 1, alongside performance data from commercial lead

ion batteries based on cobalt oxide,57 iron phosphate lithium,58

the data set excludes zinc anodes that use lead, mercury, or
cadmium. The European Union prohibits the sale of batteries
