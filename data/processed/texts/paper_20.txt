(cid:1) The minimum cost of green H2 in Iran was calculated to be between 2.94 and 3.32 USD/kgH2.
(cid:1) The minimum cost of green NH3 in Iran was obtained between 580 and 641 USD/tNH3.
(cid:1) H2 transportation via pipelines to the export harbor is the costliest scenario.

(cid:1) More than two-thirds of the cost of NH3 is caused by the power generation system.

(cid:1) Integrating green electricity into the Iranian grid is better than the P2A route.

This paper presents a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of potential

green hydrogen and ammonia production plants in different locations in Iran with strong

wind and solar resources. The study was organized in ﬁve steps. First, regarding the wind

density and solar PV potential data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highest

must be transported to the export harbor in the South of Iran. For comparison, a base case

was also considered next to the export harbor with normal solar and wind potential, but no

distance from the export harbor. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen pro-

duction facility with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers was modeled for all these

locations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the produced

hydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber-

Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis re-

quires a considerable amount of water with speciﬁc quality and because Iran suffers from

water scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challenges

associated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this re-

gard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea is

treated in a desalination plant and sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study in-

tends to evaluate the possibility of green hydrogen export from Iran, a detailed piping

model for the transportation of water, hydrogen, and ammonia from/to the production site

and the export harbor is created in the last step, which considers the real routs using

transport these media. This study provides a realistic cost of green hydrogen/ammonia

production in Iran, which is ready to be exported, considering all related processes

involved in the hydrogen supply chain.
