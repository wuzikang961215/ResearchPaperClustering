This study evaluates generation, transmission, and storage capacity needs to achieve deep renewable energy
penetration in a regional electricity grid with an average load of approximately 20 GW. Increasing renewable
energy targets are analyzed to evaluate the effects of realistic regional transmission upgrade and energy storage
cost assumptions on the cost-optimal mix of generation, transmission, and storage capacity. Contextual data is
used for New York State’s grid to examine how electricity generation from renewable energy resources (wind,
water, and solar power) can meet between 50% and 80% of electricity demand. A central finding of the study is
that when realistic transmission upgrade costs are assumed, new interzonal transmission and battery storage are
not needed to cost effectively meet near-term renewable energy goals. In fact, New York can achieve 50%
renewable energy penetration with only a buildout of new generation capacity: Onshore wind (13.7 GW), off-
shore wind (4.1 GW), and solar photovoltaics (3 GW). The presence of grid-scale battery storage, electric ve-
hicles, or additional behind-the-meter solar capacity does not markedly change the model-selected generation
mix. To achieve the 50% target, we compute a $52/MWh levelized cost of electricity for new renewable energy,
which is in line with current generation costs.

As the renewable generation target increases beyond 50%, the model begins to select transmission upgrades
and new storage capacity, the latter particularly if battery costs continue to decline as anticipated. At deeper
targets, marginal generation capacity would otherwise experience high curtailment primarily due to supply–-
demand imbalances; we calculate the value of energy storage at a 65% renewable energy penetration level to be
2.5–3 times higher than its value at a 50% level. However, the additional storage and generation – and trans-
mission, to a lesser degree – needed to achieve longer-term renewable energy goals lead to a substantial rise in
total investment. Between 50% and 55% targets, the computed marginal levelized cost of electricity for new
variable renewable energy is $94/MWh, compared to $592/MWh between 75% and 80%, suggesting alternative
integration measures are likely necessary at such high penetration rates.

1. Introduction

The use of variable renewable energy (VRE) technologies to de-
crease fossil fuel usage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is widely
accepted [e.g. [1,2]]. However, the stochastic and intermittent nature
of VRE supply is expected to require some suite of system integration
measures at large installed capacities [3]. Such measures can include
advanced grid monitoring, communication, and control [4]; expanded
transmission capacity [5]; electrification of transportation and heating
[6]; increased energy storage capacity [7]; and further interconnection
among regional systems [8]. Two integration measures that could be
achieved at large scale are the primary focus of this paper: expanded
transmission and grid-scale battery storage.

Researchers looking at transmission dynamics have shown that in-
creased transmission is more effective than battery storage at lowering
wind power curtailment [9]; curtailment is almost entirely due to
to ease
transmission constraints in some studies [10]. However,

computational requirements or to standardize across large geographic
regions, many energy system models do not account for the full set of
constraints that face new transmission projects, instead assuming (a)
costs below historical rates [5,11], (b) idealized network topologies
[12], or (c) unlimited interregional transmission capacity [13,14].

Previous analyses have modeled the ability of battery storage to
improve VRE integration [15]. Storage is shown to be a valuable bal-
ancing asset at high VRE penetration levels, but its deployment is often
not a cost-effective method of reducing curtailment; system benefits
diminish with increased adoption [16] and integration can become
largely a seasonal issue with large VRE capacities, particularly in the
case of wind power [17]. To date, energy storage has largely been used
to provide energy system services other than VRE supply shifting (e.g.
regulation services and peak load reduction) [18]. Evaluating storage
adoption and transmission expansion together, researchers have found
that in a transmission-constrained system, energy storage at generation
sites allows for greater renewable power utilization compared to sto-
rage at load centers [19]. Yet while co-locating storage with transmis-
sion bottlenecks has shown to be an effective method of integrating
VRE, such practice can also reduce the economic viability of the bat-
teries [20]. A previous study by two of this paper’s authors further
identified that large-capacity VRE supply variability is likely to be
highest distant from the VRE resource; this finding implies distributed
energy storage will have value for reliability services that may not be
captured in capacity expansion models [21].

In this study, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these two in-
tegration measures (energy storage and transmission) to achieve re-
newable generation targets (RGTs) in New York State’s (NYS) regional
grid; the NYS grid aligns with the New York Independent System
Operator (NYISO) control area. We perform simulations with and
without electric vehicle (EV) adoption, as the presence of a sizable
electric transportation load can influence how a system decarbonizes
[22]. While this paper uses the NYS system as a case study, many states
across the US have adopted RGTs [23], and all include some common
characteristics: Spatially heterogeneous electricity demands, transmis-
sion line limits, potential for battery storage, and existing fossil fuel-
based transportation that may shift to some proportion of electric ve-
hicles during a larger energy transition. Therefore, the approach de-
scribed here can be applied to any regional electric grid after adjusting
for domain-specific topologies.

Previous work by two of the authors showed that up to 10 GW of
onshore wind can be added to the NYS grid with minimal curtailment;
beyond this point, curtailment is largely a seasonal issue with higher
wind output and lower demand in the winter [24]. While this prior
work identified transmission bottlenecks, it did not evaluate whether
upgrades would be economical. A NYISO study evaluated the ability for
NYS to integrate 8 GW of wind, finding that this capacity would have no
adverse reliability impacts, would decrease total system costs, would
result in less than 2% curtailment, and would create congestion only at
local transmission facilities [25]; it remains to be seen whether these
results hold at higher renewable penetrations. Similarly, large NREL
studies investigated the integration of high levels of VRE in NYS as a
portion of the larger Eastern Interconnection [13,14]. Yet these studies
ignored intra-NYS transmission and did not quantify the cost-effec-
tiveness of various flexibility measures. [11] considered the possibility
of 100% decarbonization of all NYS energy infrastructure; however, in
modeling the state’s electricity grid, this study both ignored intrastate
transmission limits and underestimated the costs of state-specific
transmission expansion. The current paper addresses the above-men-
tioned gaps in previous NYS-specific work, and in doing so, presents a
modeling framework translatable to other grid topologies.

This paper makes two principal contributions to the literature on
VRE integration. First, it examines the cost-effectiveness of transmission
expansion in a regional grid with price assumptions based on historical
projects. Related renewable penetration studies [5,11] have un-
derstated the cost of transmission expansion, especially near high-
