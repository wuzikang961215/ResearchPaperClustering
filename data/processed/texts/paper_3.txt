Wind turbines play a crucial role in renewable energy generation systems and are frequently 
exposed to challenging operational environments. Monitoring and diagnosing potential faults 
during  their  operation  is  essential  for  improving  reliability  and  reducing  maintenance  costs. 
Supervised  learning  using  data-driven  techniques,  particularly  deep  learning,  oﬀers  a  viable 
approach for developing fault diagnosis models. However, a signiﬁcant challenge in practical 
wind power equipment lies in the scarcity of annotated samples required to train these models 
eﬀectively. This paper proposes a semi-supervised fault diagnosis approach speciﬁcally designed 
for  wind  turbines,  aiming  to  address  this  challenge.  Initially,  a  semi-supervised  deep  neural 
network  is  constructed  using  adversarial  learning,  where  a  limited  set  of  annotated  samples 
is used in conjunction with a vast amount of unannotated samples. The health status features 
present in the unannotated samples are leveraged to capture a generalized representation of the 
underlying features. Subsequently, a metric learning-guided discriminative features enhancement 
technique is employed to improve the separability of diﬀerent manifolds, thereby enhancing the 
performance of the semi-supervised training process. By employing this methodology, it becomes 
possible to develop a fault diagnosis model with superior accuracy using only a limited amount of 
annotated samples. Comprehensive fault diagnosis experiments were conducted on a wind turbine 
fault dataset, revealing the eﬃcacy and superiority of the presented methodology.

1.  Introduction

Wind energy for power generation has seen tremendous growth in recent decades around the world. The wind turbine is the 
critical energy conversion device in wind power generation. However, the mechanical structure of wind turbine is complex, and 
its working conditions are also harsh and complex. Therefore, mechanical failure of wind turbine often occurs (including bearings, 
coupling, pedestal, etc.). Health monitoring and diagnosis are essential for enhancing the dependability of wind turbines, minimizing 
operation and maintenance expenses, and preventing severe accidents [1]. At the heart of this process lies the development of

an intelligent diagnosis model that can automatically learn fault feature representation from monitoring data and make informed 
decisions [2,3].

In light of the swift advancements made in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in recent years, there have been numerous endeavors aimed 
at leveraging this technology in the area of intelligent fault diagnosis. AI-assisted diagnosis approaches can signiﬁcantly reduce 
the reliance on prior knowledge of physical fault mechanisms [4,5]. As industries generate vast amounts of big data, conventional 
manual methods for feature extraction and classiﬁcation in intelligent fault diagnosis have become increasingly complex [6]. To 
address this, deep learning methods are gaining popularity due to their ability to learn features adaptively [7–9]. Deep learning 
models, with their multi-layered structures, facilitate hierarchical feature representation, enabling more accurate fault diagnosis 
decisions [10,11]. These models have already demonstrated successful applications in practical industrial scenarios, including fault 
diagnosis [12–14], prognosis and remaining life prediction of wind turbine components [15].

Undoubtedly, deep learning provides a new framework for intelligent fault diagnosis in wind power generation devices. However, 
there are challenges associated with the practical implementation of these methods. One notable challenge is the requirement for a 
signiﬁcant number of annotated samples to train deep learning models for fault diagnosis [16]. In the case of industrial wind turbine 
equipment, acquiring a suﬃcient number of annotated fault samples is often a challenging task. Many wind turbine companies have 
limited fault data accumulated for critical components, and even when extensive data are collected by sensors, manually labeling 
them is resource-intensive. Consequently, the majority of the data remains unannotated, with only a few samples assumed to be 
annotated. Therefore, eﬀectively utilizing the available unannotated practical data remains crucial for improving the performance of 
training models. To this end, semi-supervised learning has a potential prospect in the practical diagnosis applications.

In the ﬁeld of semi-supervised learning, several common mainstream methods have emerged, including self-training [17,18], 
graph-based methods such as label propagation [19], and generative methods such as generative adversarial network (GAN) [20]
or variational autoencoders (VAE). Recently, researchers have been exploring and proposing adaptive methods speciﬁcally tailored 
for semi-supervised model training in the context of fault diagnosis [21–24].  Chen et al.  introduced a semi-supervised random 
forest within the framework of graph-based methods to eﬀectively diagnose gearbox faults in industrial systems [25]. Zhang et 
al. proposed a VAE based semi-supervised diagnosis network, which was evaluated for fault diagnosis performance using diﬀerent 
numbers of annotated samples [26]. Moradi et al. presented a semi-supervised deep model tailored for extracting a health indicator 
from structural health monitoring (SHM) data, with a particular focus on monitoring fatigue-induced loading in materials [27]. Zhou 
et al. designed a semi-supervised GAN approach to eﬀectively leverage the rich fault features present in unannotated data, thereby 
achieving accurate diagnosis of gear faults in scenarios with limited supervision [28].

Undoubtedly, maximizing the utilization of health status features present in both the limited annotated data and abundant unan-
notated data is crucial for enhancing the diagnostic capability of models. Although numerous approaches have been designed to 
leverage unannotated data to improve learning performance, the fundamental problem of sampling bias in semi-supervised learning 
has received limited attention in the existing literatures. Indeed, the observed distribution of the ﬁnite number of annotated samples 
may diverge from the true underlying distribution [29]. In this context, the integration of annotated and unannotated sample dis-
tributions through alignment emerges as a potent approach in semi-supervised learning. Adversarial learning, primarily employed 
in transfer learning to facilitate cross-domain knowledge transfer by minimizing domain shift and extracting domain-invariant fea-
tures [30,31], has also demonstrated its eﬀectiveness in semi-supervised learning. Wang et al. ﬁrstly considered the sampling bias 
problem by proposing a semi-supervised learning approach that incorporates adversarial distribution alignment [29]. Si et al. con-
ducted a study in which they employed a tightly coupled approach of adversarial learning and semi-supervised learning to align 
the distributions between annotated and unannotated data, resulting in improved accuracy for 3D action recognition [32]. Mayer et 
al. employed adversarial semi-supervised learning to enhance the performance across a range of computer vision tasks [33]. While 
adversarial-based semi-supervised learning shows great potential, it is important to acknowledge the limited research conducted on 
its application in the domain of fault diagnosis. As a result, there is a promising opportunity to investigate the integration of anno-
tated and unannotated samples through adversarial learning, aiming to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of models speciﬁcally for 
wind turbine fault diagnosis.

Semi-supervised learning is premised on the manifold assumption, which posits that samples belonging to the same health condi-
tion are distributed within a shared manifold [34]. Unlike supervised training, where the distributions of diﬀerent health conditions 
can typically be separated, semi-supervised learning leverages unannotated samples to better exploit the underlying structure of data 
manifold. However, when handling the diagnosis task with extremely limited annotated samples, it is diﬃcult to achieve eﬃcient 
decision boundary of diﬀerent manifolds/distributions for deep learning model. The eﬀectiveness of semi-supervised learning may 
deteriorate. To mitigate this issue, it is crucial to capture a more discriminative decision boundary in deep models. Metric learning 
techniques hold great promise in facilitating this objective by increasing the distance between the samples from diﬀerent manifolds 
in the deep feature embedding space, and reduce the distance between the samples from the same manifold [35,36]. In this manner, 
the learned deep models are more discriminative for the wind turbines with diﬀerent faults.

Based on the problems mentioned above, a semi-supervised approach using discriminative features and adversarial learning is 
introduced for the purpose of detecting faults in wind turbines. The proposed semi-supervised approach can achieve highly accurate 
diagnosis decisions of wind turbine faults with only limited labeled samples, which shows strong robustness and generalization 
ability. The major contributions of this research are outlined below:

1) An adversarial semi-supervised learning framework is introduced, which allows the full utilization of health status information 
contained in unlabeled samples during the training process, leading to the extraction of a more generalized feature representation 
and improved diagnostic performance.
