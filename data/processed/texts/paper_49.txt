Abstract
Grid stability can be affected by the large‐scale utilisation of renewable energy sources
because there are fluctuations in generation and load. These issues can be effectively
addressed by grid‐scale battery energy storage systems (BESS), which can respond quickly
and provide high energy density. Different roles of grid‐scale BESS in power systems are
addressed, following optimal operation approaches classification. Furthermore,
inte-
grating BESSs into distribution grids is discussed to manage challenges from distributed
generation. BESSs aid in voltage control, enhance frequency regulation, and offer black‐
start services. Aggregating distributed BESSs can provide ancillary services and improve
grid economics. For consumers, BESSs optimise energy costs, enhance reliability, and
support self‐consumption from renewables. Novel BESS services include congestion
relief, system adequacy, and power quality enhancement. Moreover, the ancillary services
provided in different European countries through BESS are analysed. Finally, a case study
was conducted among three Baltic DSOs to analyse the required amendments to Grid
Codes and Electricity Market Acts for the integration of grid scale BESS.

| Grid reliability and power quality

Grid‐scale BESS can be utilised for many different purposes in
electricity systems. At its core, BESS provides means to store
electrical energy for later usage; large grid‐scale storage can
have a substantial impact on grid performance. This energy
could be used to improve the grid reliability and power quality
by providing ancillary services such as frequency regulation.
Additionally, BESS can provide virtual
inertia, which will
become especially relevant in future largely RES‐dominated
grids. The stored energy can be used even out the daily po-
wer curve by reducing the peak power. Furthermore, it can
enable renewable integration in current grids and postpone
grid reinforcement that will inevitably be needed. In this sec-
tion these roles have been studied further.

1.1.1 | Ancillary service provision

Ancillary services are supportive services that enable the
transmission of electrical power from generation to con-
sumption by ensuring that the grid parameters are kept in safe
viable ranges. The term ancillary service can refer to a variety
of different services but from the perspective of grid‐scale
BESS what are interesting and what are currently widely be-
ing researched are the frequency regulation, voltage regulation,
and black start services.

The ancillary service market designs and product de-
scriptions vary from country to country as illustrated by the
ancillary services procurement and electricity balancing market

design survey [1] conducted by the European Network of
Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENSTO‐E).
These discrepancies could stem from the historic development
of ancillary service markets or the generation mix of these
nations. However, the EU has moved towards harmonising the
ancillary service markets with the energy balancing guideline
regulation [2], which entails that at one point all of the EU
member states should start to provide three balancing reserve
products: namely the automatic Frequency Restoration Reserve
(aFRR), manual Frequency Restoration Reserve (mFRR), that
is, secondary and tertiary reserves respectively, and Replace-
ment Reserve (RR). The provision of the primary reserve, that
is, the Frequency Containment Reserve (FCR), has not been
made mandatory; despite that many nations across Europe are
voluntarily implementing it. An illustration of different fre-
quency reserve products is given in Figure 1.

The purpose of the primary control reserve, that is, FCR
service is to be the first response to the sudden occurrence of
imbalance. Assets that provide FCR activate automatically
within 30 s in the entire synchronous are. The activation signal
for FCR does not come from the TSO, rather it is based on the
continuous measurements of the grid frequency. Adjustments
to the production and consumption of FCR providing assets
are done proportionally to the grid frequency deviation from
the norm. If the frequency deviation persists then the aFRR is
subsequently activated [3].

The secondary reserve, that is, the aFRR service will begin
to replace the FCR gradually 30 s after the imbalance occurs
and reaches the full activation within 5 min. If the grid
imbalance persists after 12.5 min of occurring then the mFRR
service, that is, the tertiary reserve, starts gradually activating
reaching the full activation at the 15‐min mark and has a
minimum delivery period of 5 min [3].

The last source of reserves, that is, the replacement reserve
(RR) uses generators with longer start‐up time to either
complement the previous reserves or to release them back into
their state of readiness. The RR has to reach full activation
within 30 min of the disturbance and has a minimum delivery
period of 15 min [3]. An alternative could be to instead use
large grid‐scale BESS. Battery storage can be a good alternative

due to its fast reaction speed, and environmental friendliness
when used in combination with RES.

From the experience of the operation of Zurich 1 MW
BESS that is used for FCR, peak shaving, and islanded oper-
ation; the main challenge for the provision of FCR is the
management of the state of the charge (SOC) shifting, which is
complicated by the internal losses of the battery and the acti-
vation signals that are generally not zero‐mean [4]. The relation
between the required energy capacity with respect to power
capacity was found to be around 220 kWh per MW for FCR
provision [5]. The effectiveness of BESS to provide ancillary
services is investigated within the PRESTO (Primary REgu-
lation of STOrage) research project [6], in particular by man-
aging the storage SOC with variable droop control.

The profitability of grid‐scale battery systems for purposes
of Primary Containment Reserve (PCR), peak‐shaving (PS),
and Enhanced Frequency Response (EFR) was analysed in Ref.
[7]. It was found that EFR purpose has the highest profitability
of the three; however, combining EFR and PS applications
improves the profitability even further.

Grid‐scale BESS usage for FCR in a low inertia grid using
grid‐forming and grid‐following methods was investigated in
Ref. [8]. It was found that large‐scale BESS can significantly
improve system frequency containment, especially in the grid‐
forming converter control mode. Future smart grids will also
inevitably encompass smaller distributed battery systems. The
authors of Ref. [9] combined smaller BESS, RES, and flexible
loads to create one large virtual energy storage system (VESS)
for the purpose of voltage regulation. An overview of ancillary
service provision with different types of ESS including BESS is
given in Ref.
the overall
deployment cost of microgrids is reduced with the utilisation
of ESS for ancillary services.

1.1.2 | Virtual inertia emulation

With the increasing RES penetration, the conventional syn-
chronous generation is starting to be phased out. The future
grids will undoubtedly have more converter interfaced gener-
ation which will result in the reduction of grid inertia. The grid
needs to have an adequate level of inertia to maintain a stable
grid voltage and frequency. With a low level of inertia, the
imbalance between the generation and consumption will start
to negatively affect the grid parameters much sooner than in
the case with higher levels of inertia. Ensuring an acceptable
balance will be even more difficult on a smaller microgrid scale.
One novel technique to increase the grid inertia would be to
perform virtual inertia emulation with large grid‐scale BESS.
inertia emulation works by imitating the inertial
response of traditional synchronous generators (SG). The
implementation of virtual
inertia is based on the swing
equation of SG that is incorporated into the inverter control
so that the typical
inertia less inverter could emulate the
inertial characteristics of SG. It is considered “virtual” since
the inertia is emulated without the utilisation of any rotating
mass [11].
