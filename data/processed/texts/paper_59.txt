ABSTRACT Cell state-of-charge (SoC) balancing within a battery energy-storage system (BESS) is the
key to optimizing capacity utilization of a BESS. Many cell SoC balancing strategies have been proposed;
however, control complexity and slow SoC convergence remain as key issues. This paper presents two
strategies to achieve SoC balancing among cells: main balancing strategy (MBS) using a cascaded hybrid
modular multi-level converter (CHMMC) and a supplementary balancing strategy (SBS) using a cascaded
parallel modular dual L-bridge (CPMDLB). The control and monitoring of individual cells with a reduction
in the component count and the losses of BESS are achieved by integrating each individual cell into an
L-bridge instead of an H-bridge. The simulation results demonstrate a satisfactory performance of the
proposed SoC balancing strategy. In this result, SoC balancing convergence point for the cells/modules
is achieved at 1000 min when cell-prioritized MBS-CHMMC works without SBS-CPMDLB and at
216.7 min when CPMBS-CHMMC works together with SBS-CPMDLB and when the duration required
reduces by 78.33 %. Similarly, a substantial improvement in SoC balancing convergence point for the
cells/modules is achieved when module-prioritized MBS-CHMMC works together with SBS-CPMDLB;
the duration needed to reach the SoC balancing convergence point for the cells/modules is achieved after
333.3 and 183.3 min.

I. INTRODUCTION
Large-scale battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are con-
structed by connecting numerous cells in series or parallel
to obtain the desired voltage and capacity ratings [1], [2].
BESS is a promising technology for power grid applications
because it has several attractive features, such as improving
power grid quality via voltage and frequency disturbance
regulation, immediate response to grid demands, enhancing
the power supply reliability by providing backup electricity,
and accelerating the interaction between electric vehicle and
smart grid [3]–[5]. Lithium-ion (Li-ion) cells have received

considerable interest from researchers due to their several
advantages, such as long lifecycle, high speciﬁc energy,
cell safety, fast charge capability and low self-discharge
rate [6]–[8]. However, cell parameter differences as a result
of manufacturing tolerances or during BESS operation lead
to inequality in state-of-charge (SoC) among the cells within
a BESS [9]. All cells in a BESS should not be overcharged or
deeply discharged [4]; otherwise, the BESS will be forced to
stop operating when any cell reaches its voltage limit where
the cells are connected in series [10], [11]. Accordingly,
the available capacity of BESS is not fully utilized even if

one cell has a different SoC than the others [10]. Therefore,
an SoC balancing circuit is required to utilize fully the avail-
able capacity of BESS [12], [13].

Different cell-balancing circuits have been stated in the
literature [14]–[41]. The circuits are categorized as passive or
active depending on their energy trading approaches. Passive
cell-balancing circuits [14], [15], also known as dissipative
cell-balancing circuits, operate by eliminating excess energy
of the cells in the form of heat by connecting a shunt resistor
to each cell. The passive approach has advantages, such as
simple implementation, small size and low cost. However, it
has some drawbacks, such as energy loss, heat problems and
its need for a relatively long time to achieve the SoC balancing
of cells. Active cell-balancing circuits [16]–[41] are designed
to transfer energy among the cells without shunt resistors,
where the energy is moved from cells with high energy to
cells with low energy. Accordingly, the drawbacks of the
passive approach have been overcome. The active approach
can be categorized into three distinct methods based on induc-
tors [16]–[18]/transformers [19]–[23], capacitors [24]–[28]
and energy converters [29]–[41].

In recent years, modular cascaded H-bridge (MCHB)
multi-level converter topologies have received a considerable
interest for their use in BESS because of their features of
using MOSFET switches, possessing inherent modularity and
reducing output voltage harmonics [30]. In [31], each indi-
vidual cell is integrated with a non-isolated DC/DC converter
and an additional capacitor to achieve SoC balancing among
the cells. However, this topology is unsuitable for grid-scale
BESS applications due to the complexity and cost with a lot
of cells required. While the researchers in [32]–[36] have
proposed to integrate each pack of cells with DC/DC con-
verter and additional capacitors to achieve SoC balancing,
the main drawback is the inability to control and monitor each
individual cell. In addition, SoC balancing for the internal
cells of BESS is not achieved. SoC balancing among the
phases and sub-modules has been achieved by using MCHB
without adding external balancing circuits [13], [37]–[40].
However, the main drawback of these topologies is that the
SoC among the internal cells of BESS is not addressed. SoC
balancing among the modules was achieved in [13] by con-
trolling their duty cycle, where each H-bridge of the cascaded
topology was connected to a pack of cells and these cells
were connected to one another in series. Pack terminal voltage
measurements are used to achieve the balancing among the
modules which is another drawback for the approach used
in [13] due to the inability to provide an accurate estimation
of SoC. SoC balancing among the modules was also achieved
in [39] by releasing the output power of each module depend-
ing on their SoC, and SoC balancing among the three phases
was achieved by controlling the zero-voltage component of
the output voltage. Each pack of cells is connected to a single
converter. Thus, an additional battery management system is
required to achieve a balancing among the cells as well as for
SoC estimation.

A. B. Ahmad et al.: SoC Balancing Control for ON/OFF-Line Internal Cells

A multi-level battery management system is developed
in [40] to address SoC balancing among the cells within a bat-
tery pack. Additional DC–AC inverters and a multi-winding
transformer are used to achieve SoC balancing at pack level
and cell level, respectively. Module balancing and phase
balancing are achieved using the same approach employed
in [39]. SoC is estimated for each pack instead of each indi-
vidual cell by using Extended Kalman ﬁlter to estimate SoC,
which is considered an extremely complicated method. SoC
balancing among the internal cells of BESS was achieved
by integrating each cell into an H-bridge without additional
components [11], [41]. Topology [41] has attractive features,
such as controlling and monitoring of each individual cell of
BESS, SoC balancing for each internal level of BESS cells
and increasing the reliability of the system by the possibility
of insulation of the failure cells. Moreover, control complex-
ity was addressed in [41] by using a hierarchical control
strategy. However, despite the aforementioned attractive fea-
tures, using a high number of MOSFET switches and taking
a long duration to achieve SoC balancing among the cells are
the drawbacks of this topology. In [42] and [43], a parallel
hybrid modular multi-level converter without SoC balancing
strategy is proposed. Compared with traditional MCHB, the
hybrid MCHB can potentially minimize the number of con-
verter components and power losses [43].

This work aims to address the challenges arising from
using hundred thousand cells as required in a grid-scale
BESS. The main challenges are control complexity and
slow balancing. In this study, two original contributions are
included. First, main balancing strategy (MBS) using a cas-
caded hybrid modular multi-level converter (CHMMC) is
proposed to maintain the attractive features of the proposed
topology in [11] and [41] while overcoming its drawbacks.
In comparison with the topology used in [11] and [41],
CHMMC is proposed to reduce the control complexity by
reducing the number of MOSFET switches to almost half
while achieving the same attractive features. Second, supple-
mentary balancing strategy (SBS) using a cascaded parallel
modular dual L-bridge (CPMDLB) is proposed to reduce
the duration needed to achieve SoC balancing among the
cells in a grid-scale BESS. The methodology of this novelty
topology is described in Section II. The balancing of BESS
for the proposed topology using control strategy is presented
in Section III. Simulation results of the proposed SoC bal-
ancing strategy with comparative analysis are discussed in
Section IV. The experimental set-up is presented inSection V,
and Section VI concludes this paper.
