Review 

Renewable energy (RE) is the key element of sustainable, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective electricity 
generation. An official report by International Energy Agency (IEA) states that the demand on fossil fuel usage to 
generate electricity has started to decrease since year 2019, along with the rise of RE usage to supply global 
energy demands. Researches on RE technologies are continuously growing in order to enhance the performance 
of RE generation, especially in term of energy conversion efficiency. The aim of this review paper is to under-
stand and study further the current RE technologies such as solar energy, hydro energy, wind energy, bioenergy, 
geothermal energy, and hydrogen energy. Several hybrid RE technologies have been also studied and compared, 
to  improve  the  overall  performance  of  RE  in  generating  electricity.  Lastly,  suggestions  are  provided  for  the 
purpose to solve and overcome the challenges and limitations of RE technologies in terms of economy, technical, 
and energy conversion efficiency.   

1. Introduction 

Nowadays,  more  sustainable  energy  technologies  are  required  to 
replace conventional electricity generation resources such as fossil fuel, 
due to the worldwide demands especially in developed and developing 
countries [1]. Fossil fuel-based energy sources are causing detrimental 
environmental issues such as global warming and climate change [2]. 
The greenhouse gas emission into the atmosphere from power genera-
tion has increased exponentially in the past few decades [3]. Therefore, 
Renewable  Energy  (RE)  technologies  such  as  solar,  wind,  hydro, 
biomass,  geothermal  and  hydrogen  energies  have  been  introduced  to 
generate electricity to overcome current environmental crisis [4–6]. Due 
to their environmentally friendly characteristics and ability to generate 
power with zero or almost nil emission of air pollutants, RE is getting 
more  and  more  attention,  due  to  the  increasing  awareness  of  clean 
environment among the society [7,8]. RE not only helps in sustainability 
but also has economic importance. It benefits the economy by reducing 
the cost of electricity generation, as it generates energy using natural, 
renewable resources [9]. Also, it can be a secondary medium of income 

as consumers can sell their generated electricity back to the power grid. 
Although the adoption of RE sources for power generation is increasing, 
majority of power generation is still performed by utilizing fossil fuel 
due to the intermittency of RE and the high initial cost. For example, 
photovoltaic system can only operate during daytime, wind turbine can 
only operate when there is sufficient air flow, and hydro turbine only 
operates when there is potential energy caused by water flow. Hence, 
researchers around the world are performing researches rigorously to 
improve the efficiency of RE, as well as overcoming their limitations. 

The objective of  this article is to  present different RE sources and 
their applications for power generation, and to promote/introduce the 
latest RE technologies proposed by researchers around the world, as well 
as discussing the limitations of current RE technologies. The rest of the 
article  is  organized  in  the  following  manner:  Section  2  presents  the 
current status of energy sector and the contribution of RE in it, Section 3 
presents the various RE energy sources which are used/developed until 
now. Energy Storage System has been considered in Section 4, Section 5 
presents  different  hybridization  techniques  for  more  efficient  power 
generation  using  RE,  Section  6  discusses  the  challenges  of  these

2. Current status of energy resources 

Even in this 21st century, most countries still depend on fossil fuel for 
electricity generation, to lack of technologies, resources, and conditions 
to  fully  utilize  RE  to  generate  electricity.  Nonetheless,  RE-generated 
electricity in electric power sector is increasing rapidly nowadays due 
to the awareness of society towards environmental concern. The figure 
below presents an example of the data and analysis of fossil fuel usage, 
comparison  of  fossil  fuel  generation  to  RE  generation,  and  trend  of 
different types of RE usage for electricity generation. 

Fig. 1 shows the total fossil fuel usage and the distributed sectors in 
United  States  in  year  2020.  In  2020,  the  total  usage  of  fossil  fuel  in 
United States was 21,365 TWh. Petroleum contributed the highest with 
44% with a total of 9400.6 TWh. Natural gas contributed 9187 TWh, 
which was 43%. The lowest was coal, with 2777 TWh used for power 
generation. As shown in the figure, there are five sectors supplied with 
power from fossil fuel resources. Transportation sectors used the most 
fossil fuel, which was 6623.2 TWh, or 31% in 2020. Besides that, 90% of 
coal contributed 2392 TWh of electricity compared to 36% of natural 
gas to produce 3529.5 TWh electricity in the same year. 

Fig. 2 shows the comparison of fossil fuel generation and renewables 
generation growth from 2010 to 2019 [11]. Due to the outbreak of the 
Corona virus pandemic, up-to-date data on global electricity generation 
in  year  2021  is  still  unavailable  from  various  platforms.  The  gap  be-
tween fossil fuel generation and RE generation has decreased from year 
2010–2020.  The  fossil  fuel  usage  for  electricity  generation  slightly 
increased from 121,531 TWh in 2010 to 136,131 TWh in 2019, but then 
decreased  in  2020.  On  the  other  hand,  renewable  generation  has 
significantly increased from 4098 TWh in 2010 to 7,140 TWh in 2019. 
Compared with fossil fuel generation, RE generation was much lesser, 
only  contributing  around  only  3.26–5.60%  of  electricity  generation 
from  2010  to  2020.  In  2020,  RE  generation  surpassed  the  fossil  fuel 
generation, particularly during the  pandemic. It is  believed that elec-
tricity generation of residential area could be fully supplied by renew-
able energy in the future. 

Fig. 3 shows the total renewable energy usage for electricity gener-
ation from 2010 to 2020 [12]. According to IEA’s global energy review 

in  2021,  total  renewable  energy  usage  has  shown  a  significant  incre-
ment,  from  4,098  TWh  in  2010  to  7,627  TWh  in  2020.  Hydropower 
contributes the largest portion of renewable energy capacity around the 
world  for  electricity  generation,  even  though  the  growth  rate  of  hy-
dropower is the lowest compared with other renewable energies. On the 
other hand, solar energy generation shows an elevating trend, particu-
larly because solar energy technologies are progressively developed and 
enhanced by researchers to obtain higher energy conversion efficiency. 
Wind  energy  generation  also  shows  an  significant  increasing  trend. 
Compared  to  the  three  major  renewable  resources,  bioenergy  and 
geothermal energy have insignificant contribution since year 2010. This 
is because only specific locations are suitable to implement geothermal 
power  plant,  in  addition  to  the  complicated  process  of  producing 
bioenergy. 

Fig. 4 shows the worldwide weighted-average levelized cost of en-
ergy  (LCOE)  between  2010  and  2020  [13].  Levelized  cost  of  energy 
(LCOE) is generally known to assess the average cost of electricity per 
kWh  for  a  generator  with  considering  all  the  expected  costs  of  the 
generator from different renewable energies which including fuel, cap-
ital, maintenance and electricity’s market price [14] According to IRE-
NA’s  renewable  power  generation  costs  in  2020,  solar  energy  system 
(photovoltaic and concentrating solar power) and wind system (onshore 
and offshore) have shown a significant decrement in LCOE from year 
2010–2020. Concentrating solar power system showed the largest drop 
amongst all renewable energies which fell by 85% from 0.381 USD/KWh 
to 0.057 USD/KWh throughout the year 2010–2020. This phenomenon 
happened due to enhancement of the current technologies in concen-
trating solar power system in term of economies of scales, competitive 
supply  chains  and  developer’s  experiences  [13].  On  the  other  hand, 
hydropower, biomass and geothermal system have shown insignificant 
changes and maintaining in the low band of LCOE throughout the year 
2010–2020.  Furthermore,  LCOE  of  hydrogen  energy  system  was  esti-
mated below 0.05 USD/KWh [15]. It is considered one of the low LCOE 
compared to other renewable energy. 

3. Renewable energy technologies 

Renewable energy is gaining wider use for power generation around 
the world nowadays. This is particularly due to society’s concern about 
environmental  issues  coming  from  the  conventional  method  of
