      "This paper presents a comprehensive technical and economic assessment of potentialgreen hydrogen and ammonia production plants in different locations in Iran with strongwind and solar resources. The study was organized in ﬁve steps. First, regarding the winddensity and solar PV potential data, three locations in Iran were chosen with the highestwind power, solar radiation, and a combination of both wind/solar energy. All these lo-cations are inland spots, but since the produced ammonia is planned to be exported, itmust be transported to the export harbor in the South of Iran. For comparison, a base case\n",
      "was also considered next to the export harbor with normal solar and wind potential, but no\n",
      "distance from the export harbor. In the second step, a similar large-scale hydrogen pro-duction facility with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers was modeled for all theselocations using the HOMER Pro simulation platform. In the next step, the producedhydrogen and the nitrogen obtained from an air separation unit are supplied to a Haber-Bosch process to synthesize ammonia as a hydrogen carrier. Since water electrolysis re-quires a considerable amount of water with speciﬁc quality and because Iran suffers fromwater scarcity, this paper, unlike many similar research studies, addresses the challengesassociated with the water supply system in the hydrogen production process. In this re-gard, in the fourth step of this study, it is assumed that seawater from the nearest sea istreated in a desalination plant and sent to the site locations. Finally, since this study in-\n",

      "In contemporary times, emerging economies are intended to achieve higher economic \n",

      "increased environmental challenges, these economies are adopting green energy as the \n",
      "key source of environmental recovery and net zero emissions. The present study \n",
      "investigates the influence of FDI, technological innovation, green energy, and trade \n",
      "on carbon emissions in BRICS economies during 1990–2022. This study also considers \n",
      "the role of economic expansion in identifying the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). \n",

      "Green hydrogen is suitable for grid-scale energy storage to increase the penetration of renewable energy, and it is \n",
      "also an alternative to fossil fuels. However, it still suffers from storage problems owing to its low volumetric \n",
      "energy density, embrittlement, and very low boiling point. To improve safety and reduce cost, green ammonia \n",
      "has been proposed as a substitute for hydrogen and has attracted considerable attention. In this study, a multi- \n",

      "narios are discussed and the performances under different energy carriers, constant and time-of-use electricity \n",

      "year. The objective was to maximize profitability, which is reflected by the cumulative cash position and payback \n",

      "grids by integrating distributed renewable generators and stor-age systems to efﬁciently serve the local demand. However, due tothe random and intermittent characteristics of renewable energy,new challenges arise for the reliable operation of microgrids. Toaddress this issue, we study in this paper the real-time energymanagement for a single microgrid system that constitutes arenewable generation system, an energy storage system, andan aggregated load. We model the renewable energy offset bythe load over time, termed net energy proﬁle, to be practicallypredictable, but with ﬁnite errors that can be arbitrarily dis-tributed. We aim to minimize the total energy cost (modeledas sum of time-varying strictly convex functions) of the conven-tional energy drawn from the main grid over a ﬁnite horizonby jointly optimizing the energy charged/discharged to/from thestorage system over time subject to practical load and storageconstraints. To solve this problem in real time, we propose a newoff-line optimization approach to devise the online algorithm. Inthis approach, we ﬁrst assume that the net energy proﬁle isperfectly predicted or known ahead of time, under which wederive the optimal off-line energy scheduling solution in closed-\n",

In VSPC, the ﬁrst model predictive control(MPC) is used with a PV array to predict the system state in thehorizon of time and to eliminate the voltage sensor. An adaptiveconcept is used for deciding the operating point, which acceleratesthe tracking process and improves dynamic performance duringirradiation changes and shading pattern changes in partiallyshaded conditions. Moreover, VSPC also takes care of the EVcharging process using the EV-provided battery managementsystem (BMS) command or threshold safety limits of the EVbattery. The working principle of VSPC is based on a predictionof the future behavior of the system. It realizes on a selected timehorizon, in an arbitrary number of samples, which is decidedaccording to the complexity of the ﬁtness function. In order tominimize or maximize the ﬁtness function, it predicts the voltageof the solar PV array as well as tunes the present control signal,which forces it to converge or reach the convergence criteria.Moreover, the cost and response time of current sensors are lowerthan voltage sensors. Therefore, the VSPC control gives a fastresponse and low power oscillations in steady-state compared toconventional techniques. This control technique is veriﬁed on adeveloped prototype of the PV system in different shading andirradiance conditions, as well as the system stability, is analyzedthrough the Bode plot. The system performance is also comparedwith the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
